Armstrong, owner of the Armstrong Ranch where the accident occurred, said Whittington was bleeding and Cheney was very apologetic.

The vice president visited Whittington in the hospital Sunday, Armstrong said.

Harry Whittington, a millionaire attorney from Austin, was "alert and doing fine" in a Corpus Christi hospital Sunday, a day after he was shot by Cheney on a ranch in south Texas, said Katharine Armstrong, the property's owner.

Cheney's spokeswoman, Lea Anne McBride, said the vice president was with Whittington and his wife at the hospital on Sunday.

On Monday, a news release from the sheriff's office said that " Whittington's interview collaborated Vice President Cheney's statement" and that the department was "fully satisfied that this was no more than a hunting accident."

McBride said Cheney has a Texas hunting license.

The man accidentally shot by US  Vice President Dick Cheney while the two were hunting on a southern  Texas ranch is in stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman said  Monday.

An interview with Whittington had confirmed Cheney's account,  the sheriff's office said.

The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department informed Cheney that he  lacked a stamp for hunting "upland game birds" in the state when the  shooting incident occurred, the vice president's office said in a  statement.

The shooting occurred late Saturday afternoon while Cheney was hunting with Harry Whittington, 78, a prominent Austin lawyer, on the Armstrong Ranch in south Texas.

US Vice President Dick Cheney  did not have a legal permit to hunt quail when he accidentally shot  a 78-year old hunting partner over the weekend, the White House said  on Monday.

Cheney spent time with Whittington, a lawyer from Austin, and  his wife at the hospital on Sunday, CNN said.

Armstrong said she was watching from a car while Cheney, Whittington and another hunter got out of the vehicle to shoot at a covey of quail.

In a statement on Monday night, Cheney's office said a member of his staff had asked the Parks and Wildlife Department for all of the necessary permits for the vice president to go quail hunting in Texas and had paid $140.

She said Cheney didn't see Whittington, and when he chose a  bird to shoot, he accidentally hit Whittington, who was "in the in the line of fire."

Whittington "came up from behind the vice president and the other hunter and didn't signal them or indicate to them or announce himself," Armstrong said.

Anne Armstrong said that on Saturday evening, Cheney spoke with her about disclosing the incident to the public.

He said Sanmiguel interviewed the Cheney and reported that shooting was an accident.

Harry Whittington, Cheney's hunting companion during a quail  hunting trip in Texas on Saturday, was mostly injured on his right side, with shotgun pellets hitting his cheek, neck and chest, the  reports said.

McClellan said he was informed late Saturday night that there had been a hunting accident but didn't learn that Cheney had shot the victim until 6 a.m. EST Sunday.

Although he broke no laws, Vice President Dick Cheney did not have proper hunting credentials when he accidentally shot a fellow hunter at a private ranch last weekend, authorities said Monday.

Cheney shot prominent lawyer Harry Whittington in the neck and  chest with birdshot on Saturday as the two were out quail hunting on  a Texas ranch.

Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally sprayed a companion with birdshot while hunting quail on a private Texas ranch, injuring the man in the face, neck and chest, the vice president's office confirmed yesterday after a Texas newspaper reported the incident.

"It was the vice president's office that took the lead on this," he said, when asked about whether he had been told that Cheney's staff was relying on a private citizen to report the accident.

An incident report by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department  said that Whittington had gone to retrieve a downed bird when Cheney  wheeled around with his 28-gauge Perazzi shotgun and shot him by  accident.

In a statement Monday night, Cheney's office said his staffers had not known about the stamp requirement and that Cheney had sent a $7 check to Texas to cover the cost.

Armstrong has said that Whittington came up noiselessly behind  the vice president, who spun around to target a bird and shot his  fellow hunter instead.

WASHINGTON - Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot a hunting partner Saturday in Texas, and the White House did not confirm the shooting until nearly 20 hours later.

Cheney was using a 28-gauge shotgun and was about 30 yards away from Whittington, she said.

The accident occurred Saturday when the vice president wheeled to shoot at a covey of quail and accidentally sprayed his hunting partner, 78-year-old attorney Harry Whittington, with bird shot, authorities said.

Whittington shot a bird and was looking for it in the tall  grass, while Cheney and the third hunter walked to another spot  and found a second covey, Armstrong said.

In an interview, Armstrong said that it did not occur to anyone in the hunting party to make news of the shooting public immediately, but that no one, including Cheney, had called for holding it back.

White House Press Secretary McClellan said he had privately urged Cheney's staff to quickly disclose details about the 5:30 p.m. CST accident on Saturday rather than wait for the Texas ranch owner to telephone the local newspaper more than 18 hours later, on Sunday.

She said Cheney participated in discussions on Sunday morning about disclosing the incident, agreeing that it should be made public but deferring to the Armstrong family on how to do so.

Cheney was described as apologetic for shooting Whittington.

Asked why getting Whittington medical attention was incompatible  with releasing details of the incident, McClellan said that the vice  president's office had "worked to get that information out."

Asked why getting Whittington medical attention was incompatible  with releasing details of the incident, McClellan said that the vice  president's office had "worked to get that information out."

7:30 p.m. EST -- White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card in Washington alerts Bush at the White House about an unspecified shooting accident within Cheney's quail hunting party but does not specify that Cheney was the shooter.

She said emergency personnel traveling with Cheney tended to Whittington until the ambulance arrived.

Armstrong said Cheney is a longtime friend who comes to the ranch to hunt about once a year and is "a very safe sportsman."

There was still no official account of the events on Katherine  Armstrong's south-Texas ranch on Saturday, when Cheney missed his  quail quarry but hit prominent lawyer Harry Whittington in the neck  and chest with birdshot.

U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot and injured a hunting companion in Texas over  the weekend, U.S. media reported Sunday.

The White House on Monday carefully distanced itself from Vice President Dick Cheney's delayed notification about his accidental shooting of a hunting companion.

Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot and wounded a companion during a weekend quail hunting trip in Texas, spraying the fellow hunter in the face and chest with shotgun pellets.

Texas officials said on Monday night that Cheney would be issued a warning citation for hunting without a proper game stamp on his license.

The White House drew fire  Monday for not immediately disclosing that Vice President Dick  Cheney had shot a 78-year-old hunting partner in a weekend incident  not reported until a day after it took place.

McClellan said President Bush learned there had been a hunting accident from White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card about 7:30 p.m. EST Saturday and learned that Cheney had been the shooter shortly before 8 p.m. EST when updated by Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove.

Whittington, 78, was "alert and doing fine" in the hospital,  Katharine Armstrong, owner of the Armstrong Ranch in south Texas,  was quoted by CNN as saying.

"The vice president spoke with (Katharine Armstrong) directly and agreed that she should make it public and that they would provide additional information," McClellan said.

Harry Whittington, 78, was peppered with shotgun pellets after  Cheney turned to shoot quail that had just been flushed out of the  brush, Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride confirmed Sunday.

Armstrong said Whittington was injured mostly on his right side, from cheek to chest.

Whittington -- a prominent Austin attorney -- and the vice president arrived for a weekend hunting trip Friday night at the 50,000-acre Armstrong ranch, a well-known retreat for wealthy Texas Republicans 95 miles south of Corpus Christi.

McClellan attributed some of the delay to Cheney's aides trying to "get the facts together (to) provide that information to the public" as well as making sure that Cheney's victim, 78-year-old Texas lawyer Harry Whittington, had adequate medical attention.

The statement said Cheney has now sent a $7 check to the department.

The Corpus Christi Caller-Times reported Monday that Cheney and Whittington had been hunting with Pam Willeford, the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein who had served for eight years on the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

The White House sought with little success on Monday to quell an uproar over why it took the better part of a day to disclose that Vice President Dick Cheney had accidentally wounded a fellow hunter in Texas on Saturday and why even President Bush initially got an incomplete report on the shooting.

After the hospital visit, McBride said Cheney "was pleased to see that he was doing fine and in good spirits."

Cheney shot Harry Whittington, 78, a multimillionaire Austin lawyer, spraying his friend and hunting partner with shotgun pellets from head to chest.

Among the people with him at the Armstrong Ranch in south Texas was his host Katharine Armstrong, a lobbyist and longtime friend of Cheney.

McClellan said he had urged speedy public disclosure following the incident at the 50,000-acre Armstrong Ranch some 60 miles outside Corpus Christi, Texas.

But hunting experts said that, although Whittington should have made his location clear, the vice president is also to blame for not keeping track of his companions.

She told the Corpus Christi Caller Times that Whittington had come up behind Cheney without alerting him that he was here.

President George W. Bush's spokesman Scott McClellan as well as  Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride insisted that the delay between  the incident and its confirmation by the White House was due to a  focus on securing Whittington medical care.

She said that Whittington shot a quail and went to look for it in the grass.

Sunday afternoon -- Cheney visits Whittington at the Corpus Christi hospital before returning to Washington, D.C.

Cheney and Armstrong "agreed that she should make that  information public.

Cheney, Whittington and Pamela Willeford, a former Texas energy executive who is now the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, went with two of Armstrong's daughters and pursued quail for several more hours.

Cheney, well-known for having testy relations with the media, on Monday came under criticism from Democrats and Republicans who said the White House should have disclosed the incident immediately.

Confirming Armstrong's account, local police and state game  officials said the vice president had spun around to target a bird  and shot his fellow hunter instead.

Sunday morning -- Cheney talks by telephone with Merce Whittington, Whittington's wife, to check on the victim's condition.

McClellan said spoke with Katharine Armstrong, one of the ranch owners and an eyewitness to the accident, and she agreed to relay word of the accident to the local newspaper on Sunday.

White House press secretary Scott McClellan said Monday that the ``first priority was making sure that Harry Whittington ... was getting the medical care that he needed.

Cheney, an experienced outdoorsman who had a valid out-of-state hunting license, will receive a warning citation for failing to purchase the required $7 stamp for bird hunting, the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife said in a statement.

Tobin Armstrong was a major financial backer of the Bush-Cheney team who died last October, with Cheney attending the funeral.

"He got peppered pretty good," Armstrong said.

Whittington was bleeding, but he was not very seriously injured, she said.

Armstrong in an interview with The Associated Press said Whittington, 78, was mostly injured on his right side, with the pellets hitting his cheek, neck and chest during the incident which occurred late afternoon on Saturday

Whittington "came up from behind the vice president and the other hunter and didn't signal them or indicate to them or announce himself," Armstrong told the Associated Press.

Whittington was treated on the scene by Cheney's traveling medical detail before being taken by helicopter to a Corpus Christi hospital.

Her lobbying clients include several that do business with the federal government, though Armstrong said she did not believe that she had ever lobbied Cheney.

McClellan as well as Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride  insisted that the time gap between the incident and its confirmation  by the White House was due to a focus on getting Whittington the  medical care he needed.

The accident happened in south Texas at the famed Armstrong Ranch, co-owned by members of a family long close to Cheney.

Anne Armstrong, a former counselor to President Nixon, has served on the board of the Halliburton Corp., where Cheney was chief executive before becoming vice president.

Cheney's staff members had asked state authorities for all  necessary permits beforehand and were never informed about the need  for a seven-dollar stamp for quail hunting, his office said in its  statement.

"He wore a brand new camouflage jacket for the occasion, which makes you wonder just how often he does really go goose hunting," Cheney said, according to a White House transcript.

Willeford, whose husband was also at the ranch, said in an interview that Whittington accepted responsibility for the accident.

When Armstrong died in October, his funeral was attended by Cheney and former President George H. W. Bush.

Bush knew an hour after the fact that a hunting accident had  taken place at 5:30 pm (2330 GMT), and it took him another 30  minutes to find out that Cheney had pulled the trigger, said  McClellan.

Hospital administrator Peter Banko said Whittington was moved out of intensive care on Monday.

And Bush spokesman Scott McClellan battled criticism over the  decision by Cheney's office to let Armstrong -- a private citizen  with no official White House role -- make the news public by  informing her local newspaper.

You now, I've been peppered pretty well myself," said Armstrong.

Texas authorities said they would issue a warning citation to  Cheney but impose no penalty or fine for failing to have the  seven-dollar stamp.

Still, McClellan blamed Whittington for the accident, noting that the attorney left the hunt line to retrieve a downed quail and was approaching Cheney from behind.

Cheney's staff did not publicly confirm the accidental shooting until 3:30 p.m. EST on Sunday, more than 20 hours after the accident, when the Corpus Christi Caller-Times posted a story on its Web site.

3:30 p.m. EST -- News organizations confirm the Corpus Christi Caller-Times account with vice president's office at the White House.

In the end, White House officials said Bush learned about the shooting accident at 7:30 p.m. Eastern time, about an hour after it happened, in a call from Andrew H. Card Jr., his chief of staff.

Tobin Armstrong was quoted by the Associated Press as saying in 2000 that he frequently went hunting on the ranch with Cheney, who turned 65 last month.

5:30 p.m. CST -- Cheney accidentally shoots Whittington.

"It broke the skin," Armstrong said, referring to the birdshot.

Whittington was about 30 yards away when he was hit in the cheek, neck and chest, she said.

News of the shooting was first revealed not by the White House  but by the owner of the south-Texas ranch, Katharine Armstrong,  where the incident took place.

Hearing a covey of birds, Cheney shot at one, not realizing that Whittington had startled the quail and that he was in the line of fire.

When asked whether the Secret Service had prevented him from talking to the vice president right after the shooting, San Miguel said: ``I'd rather not say.''

Cheney has often gone hunting as vice president, sometimes with other prominent officials, including Justice Antonin Scalia.

The vice president's office did not publicly report the accident until mid-afternoon Sunday after the Corpus Christi Caller-Times had asked about it.

8 p.m. EST -- Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove updates Bush, telling the president that Cheney was the shooter.

At the White House, Cheney made no statement and remained out of public view on Monday.

McClellan also said that details about the shooting were  trickling in throughout the night and that the White House needed  "to get the facts together."

McClellan also said that details about the shooting were  trickling in throughout the night and that the White House needed  "to get the facts together."

The party of 11 hunters set out in two trucks Saturday morning, driving around the mesquite-dotted property and shooting quail until about 12:30 p.m., said Anne Armstrong, co-owner of the ranch.

She said Whittington is a regular, too, but she thought it was the first time the two men hunted together.

Salinas said he sent his chief deputy, Gilbert Sanmiguel, to the Armstrong ranch that night.

But the Caller-Times reported Monday that McBride, after  confirming the incident around noon (1800 GMT) on Sunday, had  refused to say whether the vice president's office would have  disclosed the incident if the daily had not contacted her after  getting a tip from an unnamed Armstrong family member.

But the Caller-Times reported Monday that McBride, after  confirming the incident around noon (1800 GMT) on Sunday, had  refused to say whether the vice president's office would have  disclosed the incident if the daily had not contacted her after  getting a tip from an unnamed Armstrong family member.

Cheney thought he was shooting at a covey of quail, according to an owner of the ranch.

``He's a true Southern gentleman,'' Binko said of Whittington at a Monday news conference.

``The protocol was not followed by Mr. Whittington when it came to notifying the others that he was there,'' McClellan said.

McBride said Armstrong talked to "her local paper and when we were asked about the account she had provided, [we] confirmed that."

Ambassador to Britain Anne Armstrong, ask Cheney about notifying the news media.

Cheney, 65, was using a .28 gauge shotgun when he accidentally peppered Whittington with bird shot at a distance of about 30 yards while trying to shoot flushed quail.

Peter Binko, administrator of Christos Spohn hospital in Corpus Christi where Whittington was recuperating, said the injured hunter was cracking jokes -- and was baffled by all the publicity.

It was at dusk that Whittington shot his bird and went to retrieve it, taking him behind the vice president.

It was evident that the injuries were not life-threatening, Armstrong said, because the ambulance paused on the road for several minutes to allow Whittington's wife to join them.

Whittington was in stable condition in the intensive care unit  at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial, were he was treated for wounds  to his shoulder, upper body, chest and neck, said hospital  spokeswoman Michele Mora-Trevino.

Whittington is a longtime friend of President Bush from their days together in Austin when Bush was Texas governor.

"Fortunately, the vice president has got a lot of medical people around him and so they were right there and probably more cautious than we would have been," she said.

"Tobin is one of our dearest and most respected friends," former President Bush said.

Cheney, who was carrying a 28-gauge shotgun, had already begun to fire and sprayed Whittington.

Armstrong said she does more public relations and consulting work than lobbying, but she declined to disclose her clients.

But Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, was battered at his daily news briefing by journalists demanding answers to why Cheney had not been faster to make public what happened and why he had chosen a local newspaper in Texas as his vehicle for doing so.

While awaiting a warning from game wardens, "the Vice President  has sent a 7 dollar check to the Texas Parks and Wildlife  Department, which is the cost of an upland game bird stamp," it  said.

There is no requirement to report nonfatal hunting accidents in Texas, said Lydia Saldana, the communications director for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.

Cheney then went to search for more quail.

The pressure came in part from questions about whether Cheney might have been trying to play down the incident, a suggestion that was rejected by those who were with Cheney over the weekend.

Breaking with precedent, the White House did not disclose the  information to the national media that cover Bush and Cheney.

``This was a hunting accident,'' said Gilbert San Miguel, chief deputy of the Kenedy County Sheriff's office.

Whittington shot a bird and went to look for it in the tall grass, while Cheney and the third hunter walked to another spot and discovered a second covey.

Cheney was very apologetic, she added.

According to Armstrong and Willeford, the accident was largely the fault of Whittington, who reappeared alongside two of his hunting companions without giving proper warning.

The victim, Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old lawyer, was transferred from the intensive care unit to a private room in a Corpus Christi hospital on Monday.

But Bush did not find out that Cheney was the shooter until about half an hour later in a subsequent call from Karl Rove, his senior adviser and deputy chief of staff, who had called Armstrong to ask about the incident.

Late Sunday morning, her daughter, Katharine Armstrong, called a reporter from the Corpus Christi Caller, which then reported the shooting on its Web site.

Whittington, an Austin lawyer, was listed Monday in "very stable" condition at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas, where he was undergoing treatment for multiple pellet wounds on the right side of his lower face, neck, shoulder and chest.

Katharine Armstrong, the ranch's owner, saw what happened Saturday and told reporters Sunday that Cheney was using a 28-gauge shotgun, which shoots fewer pellets and has a smaller shot pattern than a 12-gauge shotgun, making hitting the target more challenging.

She was with Cheney at the time of the shooting, as was Armstrong, whose mother, Anne, is a prominent Republican supporter and whose family ranch is a familiar destination for Republican politicians.

The medical team that travels with Cheney immediately began ministering to Whittington, who was bleeding profusely from pellets in his face, neck and chest, according to witnesses.

The Secret Service reported the shooting to the Kenedy County sheriff's office, although no one from that agency interviewed Cheney until Sunday morning.

Armstrong played down her role as a lobbyist and suggested that she had not brought up business during Cheney's visit.

The shooting occurred about 5:30 p.m. local time Saturday and was first reported on the website of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times at midday Sunday, according to a reporter at the newspaper.

Cheney's hunting trips have included one with Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who went duck hunting in January 2004 with the vice president in Louisiana, a trip criticized because Scalia participates in decisions that affect the administration.

"It knocked him silly.

"It knocked him silly.

"He was more bruised."

At the end of a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Cheney and Bush exchanged remarks that reporters were about to enter the room, and the vice president left before the journalists arrived.

The Dallas Morning News reported that Whittington also lacked  the proper stamp for hunting quail.

The local sheriff said an investigation had concluded that the episode was "no more than an accident."

"The investigation reveals that there was no alcohol, or  misconduct involved in the incident," the Kenedy County sheriff's  office said in a statement.

"I think it's always important to get information out as quickly as possible," McClellan said.

Cheney aides continued to decline requests for an official  timeline and details of the incident, pointing reporters to  Armstrong's account and vouching for its accuracy.

Bush, who owns a ranch in Texas, and Cheney, who grew up in Wyoming, are both enthusiastic hunters, a fact they have frequently mentioned during political campaigns.

``On the face of it, this looks like something the administration felt the public had no right to know,'' Joe Lockhart, who was President Clinton's press secretary, said in an interview.

The sheriff said Sunday that they had yet to speak to "the victim."

She said she ran over to Whittington, who had fallen to the ground, but stayed out of the way while Secret Service agents tended to him.

"It broke the skin," she said of the shotgun pellets.

Armstrong spoke to the local  newspaper, the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, which had called her  after getting a tip.

Cheney, who suffered four heart attacks before he was elected vice president and has been hospitalized for heart problems while in office, always travels with a medical team.

6 a.m. EST -- McClellan is awakened at home and told that Cheney was the shooter.

"There was some bleeding, but it wasn't horrible," she said.

Katharine Armstrong starts trying to telephone Jaime Powell, a reporter at the Corpus Christi Caller Times, to describe the accident.

``We knew word would get out,'' she said.

Whittington was moved out of the intensive care unit at a hospital here Monday and reported to be in good spirits.

"I represent a couple of Texas companies, not a large lobbying practice," she said.

"The vice president didn't see him.

``You're hunting together -- you need to know where everyone is,'' said Larry Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation.

Said Jeff Hart, an Austin lawyer who hunts for quail in Texas: ``If you pull the trigger, you're responsible for it, no matter what.

The 50,000-acre Armstrong Ranch was purchased in 1852 by Tobin Armstrong's grandfather, John Armstrong III, who became known for capturing outlaw John Wesley Hardin, according to a profile of the ranch in the Caller-Times.

But, the statement said, the staff member was not informed of the need for an additional stamp, costing $7, to allow hunting of upland game birds.

Asked if she was concerned that Cheney's visit could create the appearance of impropriety during the lobbying investigation involving Jack Abramoff, which has brought to light the often close personal and professional ties between lobbyists and public officials, she said: "Oh my God, he's a friend.

The vice president's office did not disclose the accident until nearly 24 hours after it happened.

Cheney is an avid hunter who makes annual hunting trips to South Dakota to hunt pheasants.

Whittington was admitted at 8:15 pm on Saturday following the  accident and remained in the intensive care unit on Monday morning.

Monday morning -- Cheney arrives at the White House complex in his motorcade, with escorting police vehicles forgoing the usual sirens.

The  news first came to light on Sunday at 1:48 pm (1948 GMT), when the  Corpus Christi Caller-Times published Armstrong's account on its  Internet site.

The shooting was first reported by the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.

White House spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride, asked in a telephone interview why the shooting was not announced sooner, referred questions to Katharine Armstrong.

McClellan, drawing a distinction with the response by Cheney's staff, told reporters Monday: "I think you can always look back at these issues and look at how to do a better job."

She was an eyewitness, she saw what occurred  and she called her local paper to provide those facts," said  McClellan.

The incident made the front pages of The Washington Post, The  New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal, most of which  noted soberly that Cheney's office had not gone public with the  information when it happened.

After being stabilized at the hospital in Kingsville, Whittington was evacuated by helicopter to a larger facility in Corpus Christi -- where he was placed in the intensive care unit.

The local sheriff, Ramon Salinas 3rd, said the Secret Service called him shortly after the shooting occurred.

The weather was sunny and "clear" when the accident occurred and  both men were wearing blaze orange hats and vests, the report said.

"He's in good health, he's doing well," Mora-Trevino said,  adding that a release date had not yet been set for the prominent  Texas lawyer.

"The covey flushed and the vice president picked out a bird and was following it and shot.

The covey flushed and the vice president picked out a bird and was following it and shot.

But McClellan sought to deflect criticism about the slow disclosure by suggesting that Cheney's staff was responsible.

They packed the wounded attorney into Cheney's ambulance and drove him to a nearby hospital.

"The vice president didn't see him," she continued.

On Sunday morning, Armstrong tipped off her local newspaper to the story.

It was later picked up by national wire services and confirmed by Cheney's office.

Whittington has long been active in Republican Party politics and was appointed by then-Governor George W. Bush to the Texas Funeral Service Commission.

Sunday morning -- Katharine Armstrong, the host and an eyewitness to the accident, says she and her mother, former U.S.

"He understands that he could have handled it better," Willeford said.

"You need to understand that the Cheneys are our friends maybe for a couple of decades, maybe 30 years," Armstrong said, adding that she did not personally represent Parsons.

The Associated Press quoted Katharine Armstrong, one of the ranch owners, as saying she watched the shooting from her vantage in a nearby car.

His team treated Whittington before he was taken to the hospital.

His condition remained listed as stable, with wounds to his face, neck, chest and rib cage from the pellets sprayed at him from 30 yards away by Cheney's shotgun.

"He remains in stable condition in our ICU (intensive care  unit)," Michele Mora-Trevino, a spokeswoman for Christus Spohn  Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas told AFP.

"But you could say it's closed," Salinas said of the case.

Asked whether it was appropriate to have a private citizen relay information about the vice president, McClellan quipped: "That's one way to provide information to the public."

Calls to his room were routed to the hospital's marketing department, which said it was taking messages for him.

"The reason that you stay in line is so that you know where everybody is at all times," Armstrong told the newspaper.

Whittington has been a private practice attorney in Austin since 1950 and has long been active in Texas Republican politics.

Armstrong has a relatively limited list of lobbying clients in Texas and in Washington.

``It's news, and it reflects an attitude in this White House of holding back information, of being too clever by half and being secretive,'' conservative columnist Robert Novak said on Fox News.

The Caller-Times also reported Monday that the US ambassador to  Switzerland and Liechtenstein, Pamela Willeford, was part of the  hunting party.

In the final stages of the 2004 campaign, Cheney mocked the way Democratic presidential nominee Senator John F. Kerry went on a hunting trip.

And it has forced a White House already under fire for secrecy to explain why it made no mention of the shooting until the ranch owner disclosed it to a local newspaper, 18 hours after the incident.

McClellan and the Corpus Christi Caller-Times provided the following timeline:

But the incident has reverberated worldwide: ``Cheney bags a lawyer,'' was the headline in the Glasgow, Scotland-based Herald.

He was being treated in the intensive care unit at a Corpus Christi hospital.

Whittington's condition was improving and described as "stable"  by doctors at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial, where he was treated  for wounds to his shoulder, upper body, chest and neck.

"The vice president has got an ambulance on call, so the ambulance came."

During the 2004 presidential campaign, Cheney mocked Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic nominee, for having worn camouflage on a duck-hunting trip, saying Kerry's "new camo jacket is an October disguise, an effort he's making to hide the fact that he votes against gun-owner rights at every turn."

OPTIONAL TRIM -- STORY MAY END HERE

The vice president urged her to tell friends and family first, before word leaked out to the media.

She was appointed to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission in 1999 by Bush, who was then the Texas governor.

"The area affected was his shoulder, upper body, chest and some  of the neck area," she said.

(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)

I don't believe I've ever lobbied the vice president, nor would I be comfortable doing so."

The White House confirmed the shooting after being contacted by the media.

Whittington is a fixture in Texas politics, having worked in Republican campaigns dating back to John Tower's senatorial run in the 1960s.

According to public documents, Armstrong registered in 2004 as a lobbyist for Parsons, an engineering and construction firm that has done extensive work in Iraq, and listed the size of the contract at more than $100,000, according to lobbying records from the Texas Ethics Commission provided by Texans for Public Justice, a watchdog group.

"I think you can always look back at these issues and look at  how to do a better job," mused McClellan, who said he had advocated  full disclosure and left little doubt that he would have handled the  situation differently.

Armstrong did not return a call seeking comment on McBride's statement.

Whittington, bloodied but still conscious, tumbled to the ground after he was hit.

"Barbara and I loved Tobin Armstrong."

He is flown by helicopter to a hospital in Corpus Christi and admitted to the trauma-intensive care unit.

He was talking.

He was talking.

The revelation was sure to aggravate a public relations headache  for the White House, already under criticism for waiting a day to  disclose the shooting incident.

Cheney is a longtime hunter and delivered the keynote address in 2004 to the National Rifle Association, from which he accepted a rifle as a gift.

The Houston Chronicle has reported that there were 29 hunting-related accidents in Texas in 2004, with four fatalities.

It didn't get in his eyes or anything like that."

``And so, you know, unfortunately these type of hunting accidents happen from time to time.''

This past weekend brought Cheney together with a group of old friends, friends of friends and political supporters in the kind of private setting he relishes.

In hunting, the shooter is responsible for knowing where the shot is going.

He says he began urging vice presidential staff to release details of the incident.

Times staff writers Lianne Hart in Corpus Christi and Peter Wallsten in Washington contributed to this report.

Armstrong did not immediately return a telephone call seeking additional comment.

Gaming officials said they had been issuing oral warnings  instead of fines to hunters who had failed to update their licenses  under the new rule.

His eyes were open.

Whittington owns property in Travis County, which includes the state capital Austin, worth at least $11 million, the Austin American-Statesman reported last year, not counting a downtown block at the center of a long-running dispute with the city over a condemnation issue.

"He fell with his head toward me."
