Chess genius Bobby Fischer, now in a Japanese detention cell awaiting deportation to the United States, will be allowed to leave Japan for Iceland if that country grants him citizenship, an opposition party leader said Wednesday.

One of Fischer's supporters in Iceland said the Japanese government had confirmed it would allow him to go to Iceland if citizenship was granted.

Chess legend Bobby Fischer, who faces  prison if he returns to the United States, can only avoid  deportation from Japan if Iceland upgrades its granting of residency  to full citizenship, a Japanese lawmaker said Wednesday.

Iceland's Parliament voted Monday to grant Icelandic citizenship to the American chess star Bobby Fischer, laying the groundwork, his supporters said, for his release from the Japanese prison where he has been held since last summer.

Iceland's parliament voted Monday to grant citizenship to fugitive U.S. chess star Bobby Fischer.

Chess legend Bobby Fischer was on  Monday granted citizenship by the parliament of Iceland, a move  which could allow him to avoid deportation from Japan to the United  States where he is wanted for violating sanctions against the former  Yugoslavia.

Lawmakers in Iceland are likely to grant citizenship to mercurial chess genius Bobby Fischer, a member of a parliamentary committee studying the issue said Wednesday.

He said Fischer, 62, would be informed of the vote Tuesday morning in Japan, where he has been detained awaiting deportation to the United States on a warrant for violating economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by playing a chess match there in 1992.

The socialist leader said of the prospect of Fischer going to  Iceland: "Mr Miura told us that it would be okay if Iceland gives  him citizenship.

Iceland's parliament voted last month against granting Fischer citizenship, offering him a special foreigners' passport and residence permit instead.

Einarsson said that Fischer was likely to make Iceland his home, at least for the time being.

Fischer's supporters accuse the United States of piling pressure  both on Japan and Iceland so it can get ahold of the chess legend.

"We are most happy," said Einar Einarsson, a spokesman for a committee that has been trying to free Fischer from Japan, where he is being detained while he fights deportation to the United States.

Einar S. Einarsson, the former CEO of Visa Iceland who is one of Fischer's most fervent supporters, said he was optimistic.

"We are most happy," said Einar S. Einarsson, spokesman for a committee that has been fighting to allow Fischer to leave Japan, where he is being held in prison while he fights deportation to the United States.

"Mr Fischer would be free if he were not Mr Fischer," said  Masako Suzuki, his lawyer.

That would mean the  United States for Fischer.

But last week Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Japanese opposition  Social Democratic Party, told a press conference that Japanese  immigration officials would not deport Fischer to the United States  if Iceland grants him nationality.

"They had been waiting on confirmation from Japan that Fischer would be let go if he had Icelandic citizenship.

"I can't speak for the whole party, but think few if any members of Parliament are opposed to granting Fischer citizenship," said Drifa Hjartardottir, a lawmaker with the Independence Party, which governs as part of Iceland's coalition government.

Fischer became world chess champion in a 1972 match in Iceland against the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky, and some of his Icelandic supporters have campaigned to help him out of gratitude for putting Iceland in the global spotlight.

It is partly for that reason, said Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman of the parliamentary committee that recommended last week that Fischer be granted Icelandic citizenship, that Parliament voted in favor of his request on Monday.

Fischer, 62, has been detained in Japan awaiting deportation to the United States, where he is wanted for violating economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by playing a highly publicized chess match there in 1992.

But even if Iceland offered Fischer citizenship, his case would  still be in legal limbo because of his US nationality.

Since being taken into custody in July for allegedly trying to leave Japan on a revoked U.S. passport, Fischer has repeatedly denounced the U.S. deportation order as politically motivated, demanded refugee status, renounced his U.S. citizenship and said he wants to become a German national instead.

It is partly for that reason, said Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman of the parliamentary committee, who last week recommended that Fischer be granted Icelandic citizenship, that the full parliament voted in favor of his request on Monday.

But during Thursday's meeting the committee said it was awaiting more documents from Japan to be sure he would be let go if given citizenship in Iceland.

Officials at the Office of Immigration said a passport for Fischer could be ready as early as Tuesday.

Mizuho Fukushima, head of the opposition Social Democratic  Party, told a press conference that Japanese immigration officials  are opting to deport Fischer to the United States unless Iceland  grants him nationality.

Fischer, 62, who is in detention in Japan, faces prison if he  returns to the United States.

Iceland's parliament voted two weeks ago against granting Fischer citizenship, and it's unclear whether lawmakers plan to reconsider this.

Fischer is little known in Japan.

Einarsson, who called Fischer "part of our modern saga and part of our recent history," said Fischer, the 62-year-old chess champion, might be released "in only a few days" and that an Icelandic delegation planned to travel to Tokyo to escort him back to Reykjavik.

Several Icelandic politicians indicated this week that parliament was now likely to grant Fischer citizenship.

If so, an Icelandic passport would be delivered to Fischer in Japan, enabling him to travel wherever he wanted.

Einar S. Einarsson, another of Fischer's key supporters, said he spoke to the mercurial chess genius earlier Monday.

"I am very pleased with this, and I think that the dignity of the parliament has increased," Fischer's supporter Saemundur Palsson said.

Fischer hoped the vote process would be quick, Einarsson said, and "I don't think it could have been much quicker."

He also said Fischer's "personal opinions on social issues" had not been a factor.

Fukushima said justice ministry officials told her that they had  not discussed Fischer's case with their US nor Icelandic  counterparts, after opposition allegations that Japan was caving in  to US pressure.

Iceland had previously sent Fischer a passport which showed  residency status but not full nationality, a document not deemed  sufficient to save him from deportation to the United States.

"This is great news," said Fischer supporter Saemundur Palsson.

Iceland had already agreed to issue a resident's permit and special passport to Fischer, but these alone did not prove enough for the Japanese authorities.

Fukushima said Fischer, an outspoken critic of the U.S. government, was being treated unfairly.

A parliamentary committee met here Thursday to discuss granting citizenship to Bobby Fischer, but made no decision, saying it needed more information from Japan, where the mercurial chess genius is being held in custody.

Since being taken into custody in July for allegedly trying to leave Japan on a revoked U.S. passport, Fischer has lived up to his reputation for unpredictability.

He also said that Fischer's "personal opinions on social issues" had not entered into his government's decision.

But while the United States -- which is also investigating the possibility of charging him with tax evasion -- regards Fischer as a fugitive from justice, in Iceland he is seen as a national hero.

Iceland recently issued Fischer a special passport and residence permit to help resolve the standoff over his status.

Fischer has been held since July when he attempted to fly out of  Japan on an allegedly invalid US passport, but from detention he has  been unable to renounce his US citizenship.

"I do not recall being asked by the United States to do anything about Fischer," Machimura told the committee.

Legislator Gudrun Ogmundsdottir had said the citizenship motion would probably be passed by the nine-member committee Thursday, then be placed before Iceland's 63-member parliament, the Althingi.

"It was very clear from the outset that he had a great influence here," Benediktsson said of Fischer, speaking by telephone from Reykjavik.

"Fischer has money, but he can't get at it from where he is now."

Fischer's link to Iceland dates back to 1972, when he defeated  Russian Boris Spassky in a world championship match, which ended a  long domination of the game by Soviet players and was hailed as a  Cold War victory in his native United States.

Since being taken into custody in July for allegedly trying to leave the country on a revoked U.S. passport, Fischer has lived up to his reputation as unpredictable.

Iceland has offered residency to Fischer, who is famous in  Reykjavik for dethroning the Soviet Boris Spassky there in 1972 at  the height of the Cold War.

The bill went through the required three readings in 12 minutes.

"It is done.

"I hope that he will stop cursing the Americans now.

Fischer is wanted by Washington for violating economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia when he played a high-profile chess match at a resort there in 1992.

Einarsson, who called Fischer "part of our modern saga and part of our recent history," said that the 62-year-old chess champion might be released "in only a few days" and that an Icelandic delegation planned to travel to Tokyo to escort him back to Reykjavik.

All 40 members of parliament who cast their votes were in favour  of the motion to grant Fischer citizenship, while two deputies  abstained, and 21 were absent.

Most detainees at the center are deported or allowed to leave Japan within about one month, but Fischer has been in custody for eight months.

"I think that parliament may approve of the citizenship as early as tomorrow," said Ogmundsdottir, a member of the opposition Alliance Party.

"We are currently organizing a fundraising for the party that will go out to meet him," said Einar Einarsson, former CEO of VISA Iceland and one of Fischers strongest supporters.

In Tokyo, the Committee to Free Bobby Fischer praised the Icelandic Parliament, saying it had "made history by standing up to the earth's sole superpower."

After that, the always reclusive, progressively more difficult Fischer dropped out of sight, living in Budapest -- and possibly the Philippines and Switzerland -- and emerging now and then on radio stations in Iceland, Hungary and the Philippines to rant in increasingly belligerent terms against the United States and against Jews.

"A new generation of international chess players was born here in Iceland after the world championship match in Reykjavik, and it was very clear from the outset of this matter that the authorities in Iceland have very warm feelings toward this memory."

"The Social Democratic Party will bring up the issue at the  parliament and will work to let the Japanese public know about the  case," she said.

Monday's vote appears to be a resolution of sorts to the curious legal limbo that Fischer fell into in 1992 when, the United States says, he violated economic sanctions against Yugoslavia by accepting a $3.3 million fee to play an exhibition match there.

He has repeatedly denounced the U.S. deportation order as politically motivated, demanded refugee status, unilaterally renounced his U.S. citizenship and said he wants to become a German national instead.

The Iceland passport is one used by foreigners, however.

Fischer, 62, known for his maverick behavior and outspoken  criticism of his country, may face 10 years in prison if convicted  of violating US sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia by  playing there in 1992.

If it passes, it will go before Iceland's 63-member parliament, the Althingi.

Fukushima met Masaharu Miura, chief of the justice ministry's  immigration bureau, who had told parliament Tuesday that the chess  genius could only be deported to his country of origin -- the United  States.

Fischer, 62, is being held in detention just outside Tokyo pending the outcome of a lawsuit challenging the deportation order.

An immigration official at the justice ministry said that a  person with two nationalities is usually deported to the country  whose passport he or she used to enter Japan.

"The decision on citizenship lies with Parliament," said Illugi Gunnarsson, an advisor to the Foreign Minister David Oddsson.

He was taken into custody in Japan last July for trying to leave  the country on an invalid US passport.

The supporters say Fischer would not receive a fair trial in the  United States due to his controversial past statements, such as  hailing the September 11, 2001 attacks as "wonderful news" and  anti-Jewish remarks.

Fukushima, a member of Parliament, later met with Iceland's ambassador to Tokyo.

As much as the African-American track star Jesse Owens' defeat of Hitler's Aryan athletes did at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Fischer's victory in Iceland seemed to symbolize nothing less than the triumph of one way of life over another -- in this case, democracy over communism.

Monday's vote appears to be a resolution -- of sorts -- to the curious legal limbo that Fischer fell into in 1992, when, the U.S. government says, he violated economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia by accepting a $3.3 million fee to play an exhibition match there that year.

Fukushima said her party also intended to pursue the issue further in parliamentary debate.

"Somebody would then go over to Japan with the passport, which would enable him to travel here or anywhere in the world," she added.

In a telephone interview, Einarsson played down the significance of Fischer's reputation for misanthropy and his habit of making incendiary public remarks.

Iceland has sent him a passport which shows residency status but  it has not offered him nationality.

This latest episode began in July 2004, when he tried to board a plane from Japan to Manila and was seized by the Japanese authorities and accused of trying to leave the country on an invalid passport.

"The matter has been finished," said Gudrun Oegmundsdpttir, a member the General Committee.

"The matter has been finished," Gudrun Oegmundsdottir, a member the General Committee, said after Friday's vote.

"We might need to bring his girlfriend Miyoko Watai over too, as well as John Bosnitch, his supporter now in Japan, so there are expenses involved," Einarsson said.

During questioning in Parliament on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura denied allegations Tokyo is trying to please the United States by being tough.

The former grandmaster, known for his maverick behavior and  outspoken criticism of the United States, may face 10 years in  prison if convicted of violating US sanctions imposed on the former  Yugoslavia by playing there in 1992.

The media has largely ignored  his plight even though in detention he became engaged to the head of  the Japan Chess Association.

He has been held in prison since then while the various governments, as well as a staunch group of supporters in the chess world, have tried to find some resolution to what has been a vexing and delicate jurisdictional issue.

It was in Reykjavik in 1972 that he defeated the Russian world champion, Boris Spassky, in an electrifying Cold War chess contest that pitted east against west.

"This is a historic battle pitting the world's sole superpower-bully against one lone man who had the courage to fight for his own freedom to think and speak as he chooses," John Bosnitch, chairman of the group, said in a statement.

He was accused of trying to leave the country without a valid passport.

"So I don't think the Justice Ministry is interpreting the law out of consideration for the United States."

"It's been like a chess game and there's only one move left before checkmate."

Benediktsson emphasized that the granting of citizenship was considered only as a last resort, "after the applicant had exhausted all other possibilities" of gaining freedom.

"We're meeting them at 9:40 tomorrow and we want them to take the final step," he said.

Officials say they do not know how much longer that could take.

Officials, meanwhile, have taken a hard line with him.

The parliamentary committee is expected to meet again soon.

"If this was any other person, I'm sure it would have turned out differently."

The legislation, passed with 40 lawmakers voting "aye" and two abstaining following a brief debate, became law immediately.

The decision is valid from today," Atli Gislason, a  deputy from the Left-Green movement, told AFP.
