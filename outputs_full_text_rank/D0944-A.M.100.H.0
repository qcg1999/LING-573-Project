The court intervened in the Simmons case only after the Missouri Supreme Court threw out Simmons' sentence last year on the grounds that the 1989 precedent had, indeed, been superseded by the 2002 case.

Last year, the court actually reinstated the death penalty of a juvenile offender in Oklahoma after a federal appeals court had blocked it.

Justice Antonin Scalia, a death penalty supporter, said the court could be asked to declare juveniles too immature to face punishment of any kind.

The court agreed to hear the case after the Missouri Supreme Court last year struck down executions of juveniles and re-sentenced Simmons, now 28, to life in prison, deciding that such executions violate "evolving standards of decency."

Roper v. Simmons presents the court with an opportunity to strike down the death penalty for crimes committed by a juvenile.

The U.S. Supreme Court in 1988 barred the death penalty for those 15 and younger.

The Supreme Court struggled Wednesday over whether the time has come to end the death penalty for young murderers.

The best evidence for that, the court ruled, was that the number of states banning the death penalty for the retarded had grown from two to 13.

The US Supreme Court on Wednesday heard arguments on the legality of the death penalty for criminals aged under 18 in a case that has received international attention.

Using the Simmons case, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on whether it is constitutional to execute killers who were juveniles when the crimes were committed.

He also urged the court to act based on a ``worldwide consensus'' against the death penalty for juveniles, noting that except for the United States, all 110 countries that retain capital punishment do not apply it to those under 18.

The Supreme Court has been asked to rule on the fate of Christopher Simmons, who was condemned to death for the 1993 murder in Missouri of a woman who was abducted, tied up and thrown to her death from a bridge.

His advocates have said that executing people who kill as juveniles would be just as wrong as putting to death the mentally challenged, a practice outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2002.

The Simmons case would decide the fate of 73 people currently on death row across the United States for crimes committed when they were minors.

If they are joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor or Anthony M. Kennedy, the court would limit capital punishment to those who are age 18 or older at the time of their crime.

Death-penalty states during the past decade have moved to abolish the punishment as applied to minors, and the number of killers under age 18 sentenced to death has dropped from 14 in 1999 to two last year, the lawyers said, citing data from statistician Victor Streib.

The case before the court Wednesday came from Missouri.

Countering the state, Simmons' lawyers argue that the Missouri court merely followed the justices' test for determining whether decency standards have evolved sufficiently to warrant a change in applying the death penalty.

The Missouri Supreme Court last year upheld the conviction but threw out the death sentence, saying that to execute someone for crimes committed before reaching age 18 would be cruel and unusual in light of current societal standards.

Attorneys for the man, Christopher Simmons, are urging the Supreme Court to do for youngsters on death row what it did two years ago for condemned killers who have mental retardation.

Until now, the court's position has been unaffected by its 2002 decision to ban the death penalty for the moderately mentally retarded.

The Missouri Supreme Court commuted Simmons' sentence to life in prison in 2003, and the state has appealed that decision.

Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas have said the court should leave the issue to the states.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday struggled to assess the morality and propriety of states' executing murderers who killed at age 16 or 17 _ the ultimate punishment carried out in few places outside the United States.

The US Supreme Court abolished the death sentence for those aged under 16 in 1988.

The Supreme Court upheld capital punishment for 16- and 17-year-old offenders in 1989.

But Kennedy responded that many 17-year-old offenders were ``ringleaders'' in brutal, calculated murders, according to a friend-of-the-court brief filed by a group of states that wish to retain a death penalty for juveniles.

Because nearly the entire world has outlawed the juvenile death penalty, court watchers are interested in whether justices will cite foreign practices, as some did when striking down sodomy laws two years ago.

James Layton, representing the state of Missouri, said the court's judgment about unconstitutional punishment in America "should not be based on what happens in the rest of the world."

If so, the Supreme Court may force a profound shift in how criminals are sentenced in America, one that will affect the state courts in many states as well as the federal system.

However, the court may decide that a ``national consensus'' has now formed against imposing the ultimate penalty against minors -- just as it did in 2002 with respect to the death penalty for moderately mentally retarded offenders.

The Missouri Supreme Court voided the death sentence and ordered him to spend life in prison, and the state attorney general filed an appeal.

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the other swing vote, noted that several states in recent years have raised the minimum age to 18 for imposing the death penalty.

But Kennedy noted that the American Psychological Association -- which told the court in a brief in this case that adolescents were too immature to qualify for capital punishment -- had also said in a case about parental notification for abortion that teen-agers were old enough to make such a decision on their own.

The case arrives two years after its decision to strike down the death penalty for mentally retarded criminals.

He told the court that the execution of juvenile criminals conflicts with a ``robust consensus'' reflected in the recent decisions of several states to ban the practice and in the decreasing frequency with which juries actually impose the death penalty on those under 18.

Simmons was sentenced to die, but Missouri's highest court overturned the sentence last year.

Yet in the 2002 opinion, written by Stevens, the court seemed to warn that it was not ready for that, contrasting the strong trend against executing the retarded with the fact that, between 1989 and 2002, only two states had raised their death penalty ages to 18.

Three times in the last two years, the court refused to hear appeals from death-row inmates who had killed while juveniles -- despite a strongly worded dissent in one case from Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.

It based its decision largely on the growing number of death-penalty states to have outlawed such executions: up from two in 1989 to 16 in 2002.

Nixon, pressing Missouri's appeal to the justices, assails that ruling as violating the U.S. Supreme Court's still valid decision from 1989 that executing 17 year olds is permissible.

In taking the case of a man convicted of murder when he was 17, the court will reconsider its 1989 decision in Stanford v. Kentucky that the Constitution permits the execution of 16-year-old killers.

04-105 -- would mark this as an unusually important term for criminal law, the justices have also agreed to decide a significant death penalty case.

Currently, most states either have no death penalty law or set 18 as the minimum age.

Two years ago, the court in a 6-3 decision abolished capital punishment for the mentally retarded, saying that a ``national consensus'' had emerged that executing such persons amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.

While President Bush and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., pound away at each other on the stump, the nine justices will start their session at 10 a.m. with the court's marshal saying, "God save the United States and this honorable court."

It is nearly certain that the court's two swing voters, Justices O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy, will determine the outcome.

A possible revolution in the federal criminal justice system will be on the agenda when the Supreme Court opens its new term Monday.

On Oct. 13, the court will hear arguments in Roper vs. Simmons, No.

Bush administration lawyers appealed Fanfan's case directly to the Supreme Court.

In that case, Blakely vs. Washington, the court struck down Washington state's sentencing guidelines, which, like the federal guidelines, permit judges to boost sentences based on their own post-conviction fact-finding, rather than relying only on facts admitted by the defendant or found by a jury.

"I believe age should factor in some way _ not the death penalty," Benjamin said from prison.

``I'm very concerned about that,'' Kennedy told Seth Waxman, a former solicitor general of the United States who was arguing on behalf of Missouri death row inmate Christopher Simmons, who faces execution for a murder he committed at 17.

``I'm very concerned about that,'' said Kennedy, who voted in the majority to stop the death penalty for mentally retarded individuals.

The court has outlawed executions for those 15 and under when they committed their crimes.

WASHINGTON -- The death penalty, drugs and civil rights are before the Supreme Court in its new term, which begins Monday with relatively little public notice amid the presidential campaign's final month.

A plea to declare capital punishment for juvenile offenders unconstitutional received a skeptical hearing at the Supreme Court Wednesday, as one of two justices likely to be pivotal to the outcome voiced repeated doubts.

In recent rulings, however, a narrow Supreme Court majority has said the right to a jury trial also includes the right to have a jury decide the key facts that determine a sentence.

The court has barred capital punishment for those younger than 16, but it ruled in 1989 that capital punishment for 16- and 17-year-old defendants does not constitute ``cruel and unusual punishment.''

The Supreme Court ruled in Blakely v. Washington that the state system violated the constitutional right to trial by jury by permitting judges to make these essential findings.

Four members of the court -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- have already declared in a published opinion that they believe the death penalty for juveniles should be abolished.

The San Francisco-based court said Congress' constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce cannot be invoked to outlaw the medicinal use of marijuana grown, prescribed and used in the same state.

In 1988, the court prohibited the execution of those whose crimes were committed at 15 or younger, but refused the next year to extend that decision to 16- and 17-year-olds.

The justices will hear arguments in the Missouri case, Roper v. Simmons, on Oct. 13 and render their decision by the summer.

About 20 states allowed executions of retarded people when the court voted 6-3 to outlaw them.

Kennedy said he was concerned that eliminating the death penalty for young criminals would remove a "deterrent", notably among gang members.

The justices will take up a Missouri case, Roper vs. Simmons, on Oct. 13 to decide the issue.

James Layton, a Missouri state attorney, urged the justices to let juries weigh each case and decide for themselves when a murderer deserves death.

The liberal dissenters said the court should uphold the broad power of Congress.

Seventy-three people are currently on death row in 12 states -- one-third of them in Texas -- for crimes committed before the age of 18.

The justices' most pressing task is to resolve the fate of the federal criminal sentencing system, which the court itself threw into limbo in June by declaring unconstitutional a similar, although not identical, system used by the state of Washington.

Though the court said in Blakely that it did not address the federal guidelines, the similarities between Washington's system and the federal system were such that defense lawyers across the country immediately began bombarding courts with Blakely challenges to their clients' sentences.

In Ashcroft v. Reich, the court will consider whether federal agents lack authority to interfere with medical marijuana grown by seriously ill people who do not take it across state lines.

To raise that minimum age, the court would need to decide that a national consensus has emerged since that year that it is cruel and unusual to execute murderers who had not reached adulthood when they committed their crime.

Although determining the precise magnitude of the Blakely aftershocks is the court's first major item of business, Blakely is by no means the only case of potential national significance on the court's docket.

They noted that all but a handful of states had exempted mentally retarded persons from the death penalty.

Since the 1976 reinstatement of the death penalty, 22 people _ 13 of them in Texas _ have been executed for crimes committed as 16- or 17-year-olds.

They said Simmons believed he could escape punishment because he was a juvenile.

The wine and marijuana cases will come before the court in December.

But when the court's term officially opens Monday, the first order of business will be to answer a question raised at the end of the last term: Is the federal sentencing system, which punishes 64,000 criminals a year, unconstitutional because it allows judges, acting alone, to add to prison terms?

"Why pick on the death penalty?

Seth Waxman, the former U.S. solicitor general in the Clinton administration, argued for Simmons and he urged the high court to set a constitutional rule that limits capital punishment to those who are legally adults.

That is the test the court applies to decide whether a punishment is "cruel and unusual" within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.

The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a generally liberal court based in San Francisco, ruled that home-grown and home-consumed marijuana is not related to interstate commerce, and so the Constitution does not give Congress the authority to regulate it.

"This represents another case in an ongoing battle between the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit is playing games," said Michael Gottesman, a law professor at Georgetown.

The Supreme Court increasingly has looked at international opinion.

Other than a prior conviction, ``any fact that increases the penalty for a crime'' must be decided by the jury or admitted by the defendant, Justice Antonin Scalia said for a 5-4 majority in the case of Blakeley vs. Washington.

Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.

Challengers to the juvenile death penalty similarly argue that the number of death sentences for offenses committed by minors has dwindled and there is a growing reluctance to carry out such executions.

But before the court can take on the new issues, it will revisit its 5-to-4 decision last term in Blakeley v. Washington.

Still, 19 of 50 states allow the death penalty for those older teenage killers.

"It makes your hands sweat, your stomach sick," Mitchell said, hoping for the day that Simmons is put to death.

Though the Missouri court might feel times have changed, it must continue to rely on the justices' determination, he writes in the state's appeal.

The court had upheld both policies in 1989.

Although there have been few executions for juvenile crimes in recent years, the United States is one of only a handful of nations where such executions are still legal, and the case has attracted worldwide attention.

Death is the wrong punishment for crimes that reflect ``the transient psychosocial characteristics that rage in adolescents,'' Waxman said.

The case is Roper vs. Simmons.

But the Supreme Court frequently reverses the Ninth Circuit and has consistently rejected challenges to federal drug laws.

Crook's death, he said, is "not something that can be easily blocked out."

The U.S. government supports Jackson's position in a legal brief filed with the court.

Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the federal Controlled Substances Act cannot be enforced against two California residents who were prescribed marijuana to treat debilitating medical conditions.

The justices, however, would not shy away if this year's election also arrived at their doorstep, added Olson, who served from 2001 until July as U.S. solicitor general, President Bush's top lawyer before the high court.

Still, 19 states permit prosecutors to seek a death sentence for murderers who are 16 or 17, although fewer have done so of late.

The coming term marks the 11th consecutive one with the same nine justices, further extending this panel's modern record for Supreme Court stability.

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a moderate expected to be a key swing vote, said that with world opinion against the punishment, "Does that have a bearing on what's unusual?"

In Clark v. Martinez and Benitez v. Bozos, for example, the court will decide whether the government can continue to indefinitely imprison Cuban criminals from the 1980 Mariel boat-lift who were never granted legal entry into the United States, but were "paroled" into the country.

``Juveniles run in gangs,'' he said, reasoning that gang members would dodge the death penalty by recruiting their youngest members as ``the hit man.''

Three months ago, the Supreme Court issued an opinion that seemed to outlaw the way much of the nation sentences criminals.

The Supreme Court justices, a solemn and sober lot, will spend time this fall talking about wine, beef, marijuana and dogs, all part of their wide-ranging duty to police the limits of the government's power.

But Simmons' attorney, Seth Waxman, replied that the death penalty was a useless deterrent against minors since "they weigh risks differently" to adults.

Only two teenage murderers received death sentences last year and only one such sentence has been handed down this year.

Waxman said there was no inconsistency, because ``what was at issue in that case was the competency to decide,'' while the question in this case is ``factors why adolescents are less morally culpable.''

``This case will determine whether consumers or a cartel of billion-dollar distributors will determine what wine is available to consumers in New York or two dozen other states,'' said Clint Bolick of the Washington-based Institute for Justice, who represents Lucas.

Opinions given for previous cases indicate that the court's four more progressive justices favor abolishing juvenile execution.

In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Jackson argues that the right to sue for retaliation is implicit in any anti-discrimination law.

On Wednesday, the justices debated whether a similar national consensus exists that now calls for limiting capital punishment to murderers who are age 18 or above when they commit crimes.

If the court throws out the sentencing guidelines, the issue will return to Congress.

In a case on marijuana, the justices will consider whether Congress overstepped its authority by outlawing marijuana use for medicinal purposes when the plant is grown in the same state where it is prescribed.

It is the kind of fact a legislature should decide, not this court,'' he argued.

Kennedy's vote is crucial because four justices, John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, have already declared their belief that executing those who commit crimes while under the age of 18 is ``cruel and unusual punishment.''

The court found that a national consensus against the practice had formed since 1989.

"We are literally alone in the world," said Seth Waxman, Simmons' lawyer.

Circuit Court of Appeals turned the tables.

The future of the death penalty for young murderers also is in doubt.

Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas opposed the 2002 mental retardation ruling, which opponents of capital punishment for juveniles are relying on to make their case.

But Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon says the court should hold fast to its decision allowing the execution of minors.

The Supreme Court opens its new term Monday faced with urgent business and looming uncertainty.

``We are literally alone in the world'' in permitting the executions of those who committed crimes as juveniles, Waxman said.

The outcome appeared in the balance with the nine member court divided and the result likely to be decided by the two moderate justices.

If the court strikes down guidelines, many current defendants could receive only a minimum sentence.

That invokes the same reasoning that conservative majorities on the Supreme Court have used to strike down federal laws against guns in schools and violence against women.

O'Connor compared society's evolution toward opposing the juvenile death penalty to its position on executing the mentally ill.

In addition, Congress tramples on states' rights when it seeks to regulate the use of a drug that state law says may be prescribed for certain medical conditions, Angel Raich and Diane Monson state in papers filed with the justices.

The new term is dominated by criminal justice matters, with cases involving the death penalty for juveniles, medical marijuana, drug-sniffing police dogs during routine traffic stops, and the continued detention of Cubans brought over during the Mariel boat-lift who finished their prison sentences but cannot be returned to Cuba because Fidel Castro will not take them back.

The justices will meet behind closed doors later this week to vote on the case of Roper vs. Simmons.

States that permit it ``are not just alone in this country, they are alone in the world,'' he said.

But Justice Ruth Ginsburg interrupted him to highlight that in the United States people under 18 years old cannot "buy tobacco, vote, sit on a jury."

Fanfan's is one of two cases that will be heard Monday afternoon as the justices debate what to do with the federal sentencing system.

Because as many as 21 states and the federal government use a similar arrangement, the ruling cast much of the criminal justice system into doubt and had an immediate impact on thousands of open cases.

They will also consider whether young murderers can be put to death for their crimes.

The four most liberal members _ Ginsburg, Breyer, and Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter _ have taken a stand against the death penalty for minors, saying it is "a relic of the past and is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency in a civilized society."

"If you play games and the other side is the Supreme Court, you're not going to win."

The case of John Ashcroft vs. Angel Raich may determine the fate of the medical marijuana laws in nine states.

That, the court ruled, violates the right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.

Justices debated whether such killers are children who cannot grasp the consequences of their actions and should be kept from death row, or criminals whose executions would ensure justice for victims and deter other youths.

Addressing Layton, she noted that the number of states that either do not have capital punishment or set the age at 18 is ``about the same'' as the number of those that banned executing the retarded in 2002, which was 30.

The court is hearing the case on an expedited schedule in response to the uproar and confusion created by a 5 to 4 ruling it issued June 24, just before leaving for summer recess.

They heard arguments in a Missouri case involving Christopher Simmons, who at 17 kidnapped a neighbor and threw her off a bridge.

03-633, a challenge to the constitutionality of the death penalty for persons who commit crimes while younger than 18.

Many death penalty opponents immediately recognized that a similar argument could be applied to juveniles.

Since young people need to be age 18 to vote, to join the military, to gamble, or even to marry without their parents' consent, it is reasonable to set 18 as the minimum age for capital punishment, he said.

People carrying sleeping bags arrived at the Supreme Court before midnight in hopes of getting a seat for the argument.

Justice Stephen Breyer asked, adding that he was not implying that it was up to the world to impose law on the United States.

In that case, it struck down guidelines under which judges add time to the normal range for a sentence based on aggravating facts not found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury - for example, increasing the penalty for a kidnapping conviction if the offense involved cruel mistreatment of a victim.

Lawyers for Garrison Johnson, a black inmate, say racial segregation is unconstitutional in all instances.The court also will decide whether police can use drug-sniffing dogs in routine traffic stops.

Nineteen states allow executions of killers who were 16 or 17 at the time of the crime.

As of June 30, 72 people who were 16 or 17 at the time of their crimes sat on death rows around the nation, and 28 of them were in Texas.

"Local manufacturing, possession and use of controlled substances increase the demand for such drugs, which in turn leads to increased supply and marketing to users," the government states in papers filed with the high court.

While the sentencing cases alone -- United States v. Booker, No.

In Illinois v. Caballes, the court will decide whether police may search a car with a drug-sniffing dog during a routine traffic stop without an individualized reason to be suspicious.

Four justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- have said in the past they believe such executions are a ``shameful practice'' and should be abolished.

In that case, Kennedy and O'Connor joined Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.

No terrorism case is on the calendar following the court's historic decision in that arena last term, when it sharply curtailed President Bush's claimed wartime power to indefinitely imprison suspected terrorists beyond the reach of judicial review.

"They (the justices) are probably perfectly happy that people are concerned about other things," said attorney Theodore Olson, who argued Bush's case in the 5-4 decision in Bush v. Gore that ended the Florida recount, sealing Bush's victory.

I think of that all the time," she said.

In a rare two-hour afternoon oral argument session, the justices will consider whether the federal sentencing guidelines -- a manual of 400-plus pages meant to ensure that federal courts give defendants across the country approximately equal punishments for similar crimes -- can be reconciled with the Constitution.

Kennedy said, "What we do here should influence the rest of the world."

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he was worried that teenage criminals will be emboldened if they are free from the full force of the criminal law.

If the age for capital punishment needs to be changed, it should be done by elected lawmakers, not judges, he said.

"There was an inexorable trend concerning mental retardation, not here," Layton said, adding that if the number of executions of minors has decreased in the last few years it could rise in the future.

In 2001, the court ruled that detaining legal immigrants for more than six months was unconstitutional.

The U.S. District Court for Northern Alabama dismissed Jackson's lawsuit, saying Title IX has no provision allowing people to sue for retaliatory actions by school officials.

Four liberal justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- have already said they view such as executions as ``shameful'' and a ``relic of the past.''

The amendment states that ``importation into any state .

The court also will hear a challenge to a unique California prison policy that segregates new inmates by race for as many as 60 days.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, who along with Sandra Day O'Connor are considered the moderates, asked whether world opinion should be taken into account.

Declaration of Independence, said that for the United States to lead, it must "show a decent respect for the opinions of mankind."

The arguments Monday will kick off a near-record 10th term for the court without a lineup change.

In the last 10 years, only three states -- Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia -- have executed persons who were under 18.

He was sentenced to death in 1994.

Authorities said Simmons privately boasted of killing Crook because she had seen his face.

This case will decide whether people who have not legally entered the country have the same rights.

``They flip-flopped,'' Kennedy said.

Juvenile offenders have been put to death in recent years in just a few other countries, including Iran, Pakistan, China and Saudi Arabia.

The three most conservative members of the court seemed to lean toward allowing the practice to continue.

The justices seemed sharply aware of the world audience as they discussed whether the executions are cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Constitution.

California voters legalized medicinal marijuana in state law eight years ago, but it remains illegal under federal law.

In 2002, it overturned a 1989 ruling that had permitted executing the mentally retarded, saying that a national consensus had emerged that executing such people violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

The United Nations Commission on Human Rights said six nations besides the United States executed juvenile offenders during the 1990s.

In law, ``18 is the bright line between childhood and adulthood,'' he said.

The court is expected to render by the summer its decisions in the approximately 80 cases it will hear between October and April.

Only a few states still order executions for juveniles.

However, Ashcroft, the U.S. attorney general, says federal drug laws forbid all use of marijuana.

Now that Iran and Congo say they have repudiated the practice, the United States stands alone in the world in sanctioning the execution of minors.

Kennedy said the brief was ``chilling reading.''

The case is Ashcroft v. Raich.

``It's about the same consensus that existed on mental retardation,'' she said, in a hopeful sign for the foes of capital punishment.

The records of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas suggest that they think the issue should be left up to the states.

"I have a picture in my mind that she can't see, she can't speak, she can't scream out," Crook's daughter, Kimberly Hawkins, said at Simmons' trial.

Simmons was convicted and sentenced to death in 1993, when he was 17, for forcing Shirley Crook from her bed, tying her hands and legs together with electric cable, covering her face with duct tape and pushing her from a railroad trestle into a river below, where she drowned.

The majority said such a system violates the Constitution's guarantee of a jury trial.

She pointed out that the statistics about the use of executions for juveniles showed the same consensus as existed two years ago against executing the mentally retarded.

But the United States remains one of five countries that allow the execution of those aged 16-18 and there has been growing domestic and international pressure to halt that as well.

04-104, and United States v. Fanfan, No.

The court must decide whether defendant Melvin Smith's "double jeopardy" protection against successive prosecution was violated when a judge first granted a defense motion to declare him not guilty of a charge, then withdrew that verdict and allowed the charge to go to a jury.

``It looks like a Number 10 earthquake to me,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who dissented in Blakely, told a conference of federal judges in July.

said Mitchell, 66.

The question in Roper v. Simmons, No.

"No," answered James Layton, representing Missouri state which wants Simmons executed.

Justice Anthony Kennedy observed that he was ``troubled'' that a ban might lead gang leaders to use 16- or 17-year-olds as ``hit men.''

Appealing that decision to the justices, the government says Congress can outlaw the intrastate use of dangerous drugs even if state law allows doctors to prescribe them.

Whether that judgment is correct and, if so, what should happen next will be the subject of an unusual afternoon argument on Monday in two cases that the justices -- in August -- granted at the Justice Department's request and agreed to expedite for an argument.

They have to decide just how much remains of the federal sentencing system."

But its report said all of these countries have repudiated the practice in the past five years.

Accordingly, the U.S. Education Department has adopted regulations that protect teachers who complain about illegal bias, Jackson states in papers filed with the justices.

O'Connor, who joined Kennedy in passing a 2002 decision barring the execution of mentally ill people, appeared to agree.

A Connecticut case, Kelo v. New London, will determine whether a government can use eminent domain to clear space for private redevelopment.

Only two teenagers were condemned to death in 2003, compared with 15 in 1999.

"Bubble, bubble," witnesses later said they heard Christopher Simmons snicker as the woman's body sank.

"They went off for three months on vacation, leaving a lot of people scrambling to figure out how to make the system work," said Julie O'Sullivan, a law professor at Georgetown University.

That simple statement struck down the sentencing system in Washington state, and it now threatens to do the same in the federal system.

In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Benjamin, now 26, said he hopes Simmons prevails, thinking adolescence mitigates culpability.

The case is Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education.

In both the state and federal systems, sentencing guidelines provide a starting point for calculating a criminal sentence, and judges then make findings about a variety of factors to determine how much time a defendant will actually serve.

Until now, the general understanding has been that prosecutors charge defendants with a crime, juries typically decide whether they are guilty and, if so, judges impose the punishment.

Prosecutors said the defendant was the leader of a drug gang who had 2.5 kilograms of cocaine in his home and car.

A long list of other groups, including the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the European Union and Nobel Prize laureates led by former President Carter, filed briefs urging the court to halt the execution of young offenders.

Kennedy and O'Connor supported the 2002 decision.

Benjamin, tried separately as an adult but not eligible for the death sentence, given his age, was convicted and sentenced to life without parole.

Despite the vote of two years ago, it was not clear from Wednesday's argument that a majority would exempt youthful killers.

In the case of Granholm vs. Heald, they argue that the Constitution calls for a free flow of commerce across state lines, including that of alcohol.

Federal judges around the country quickly started ruling that they could no longer treat the federal sentencing guidelines as binding.

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, also an important swing vote, spoke only once during the arguments.

In the meantime, the justices have filled half the term's calendar and continue to review other appeals; one closely watched potential case is a challenge to Florida's ban on gay adoptions.

A jury found him guilty as charged of selling at least 500 grams of cocaine, a crime that called for six years in prison under U.S. sentencing guidelines.

Mitchell believes Simmons, who was then 17, was old enough to know right from wrong.

On this point, Kennedy appeared to sympathize with Waxman, asking Missouri state solicitor James Layton, ``There seems to be a very substantial demonstration that world opinion is against us.

Justices repeatedly referred to arguments filed on behalf of Simmons by foreign leaders, Nobel Peace Prize winners and former U.S. diplomats.

That leaves only Kennedy and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as possible fifth votes for a ban.

In 1999, for example, 14 underage murderers received death sentences, but the number has declined steadily.

"You know how many people get married or join the service when they're 17 or 18 years old?"

The Missouri attorney argued that "there are 17-year-olds that are equally culpable as 18-year-olds."

The vote was 5 to 4, with both Kennedy and O'Connor in the majority.

03-633, is whether executing someone convicted of committing a capital murder at the age of 16 or 17 offends "evolving standards of decency in a civilized society."

Quoting President Thomas Jefferson, one of the framers of the US Constitution, she said, "To lead the world you must show a decent respect of mankind."

Simmons was convicted of the 1993 murder of Shirley Crook.

Some killings are so heinous as to warrant not only charging minors as adults -- as is often the case today -- but to hold them to the ultimate penalty as well, he argues.
