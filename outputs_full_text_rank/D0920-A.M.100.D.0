The singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, now Yusuf Islam, is trying to get off the no-fly list after he was removed from a London-to-Washington flight because the list said he had links to terrorists.

Islam said he had been well treated by U.S. officials.

Surrounded by a throng of reporters at Heathrow Airport on Thursday, Islam said it was ludicrous that he's on Washington's no-fly list, suspected of ties to terrorists, and said he would challenge the decision to block him from entering the country.

"OK," Stewart said.

"Triumph, Jon," the correspondent said.

US authorities diverted a Washington-bound Air France flight after discovering that a passenger was part of a "no-fly" list of people deemed a security risk, a US security official said Sunday.

When Cat Stevens was barred from entering the country late last month after showing up on a terrorist watch list, Borowitz said he sat down to write a fake news story about it.

Britain has complained to the United States about the treatment, and Islam has said he plans legal action against U.S. authorities.

"From our side, it's not dark," Loeffler said.

The singer once known as Cat Stevens, now a peace activist whose name was on a U.S. list of people suspected of having terrorist links, will receive a peace prize from a foundation headed by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, organizers said Monday.

We'll see," he said.

"The premise of any joke delivered by oddball newscasters is that they're making fun of the media's treatment of news as much as they are the subjects of the news," he said.

The whole thing is totally ridiculous," said Islam, who had a string of hits in the 1960s and '70s, but abandoned his music career after converting to Islam.

"I request you, in the name of Allah ... to release the British citizen Ken Bigley for the good name of our religion and according to the sayings of Allah in the Glorious Quran," said Islam, who was taken off a Washington-bound plane last month and expelled from the United States after his name turned up on a list of people suspected of having terrorist links.

For one thing, he said, the audience could not possibly get the jokes if it did not already know the news stories that were being spoofed.

"Good music doesn't have to have a name on it," Loeffler said.

"Music is so much feeling and emotion," he said.

The "Man for Peace" award was being given to Islam "for his dedication to promote peace, the reconciliation of people and to condemn terrorism," said a press release by the Gorbachev Foundation and Rome's City Hall.

"We need urgently the new system of Secure Flight to avoid" incidents like the one that occurred Saturday, he said.

"Remember," he said gravely.

"Yusuf Islam has been placed on the watch lists because of activities that could potentially be related to terrorism," Doyle said.

A statement on Islam's Web site said he was seeking further information from U.S. authorities "so that we can challenge the decision to refuse him entry."

"Nothing is more serious and pompous than a network news anchor or the earnest prose style of a newspaper," Borowitz said.

"People are getting their news from the tops of taxi cabs, from sluglines on Yahoo and from accidentally stopping on CNN," he said.

"It's pretty cheesy, but the thread is, it's good music," Loeffler said.

Islam will receive the award from Rome Mayor Walter Veltroni and Gorbachev, the spokesman said.

A similar incident involving British singer and peace activist Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, occurred in September, when his Washington-bound flight from London was diverted to Bangor.

US Customs officials took the passenger into custody, as well as a person who was traveling with the passenger on the no-fly list, Clark said.

"It represents a healthy society," she said.

"Our religion Islam does not allow us to harm the innocent," said the Muslim Council of Britain's Iqbal Sacranie in the leaflet.

The singer, now named Yusuf Islam, is expected to attend the ceremony on Rome's Capitoline Hill on Wednesday, said Enzo Cursio, a spokesman for the Gorbachev Foundation.

"The one positive thing I can say is that a lot of security officers are pleased because they got my autograph," he said.

"The flight was diverted after it was learned that a passenger on the no-fly list was onboard the aircraft, so out of an abundance of caution TSA took swift action to divert the flight to Bangor, Maine," she said.

A similar incident involving British singer Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, occurred in September, when his Washington-bound flight from London was diverted to Bangor.

He said a process of redress wasn't needed until Secure Flight begins.

"There's some weird handcuffs on the mainstream news so that they feel that no matter what, they have to present both sides of the argument, even if one side of an argument is wrong," Karlin said.

"You don't have to start by saying to the audience, 'See, there was this singer-songwriter from the '70s named Cat Stevens,"' he said.

Shelley Ross, the producer of "Prime Time Live" who came up with the idea to do the musical news satire gag on her program, inspired by "That was the Week That Was" in the 1960s, said she felt satire was a proper response to searching times.

Under the system, called "Secure Flight," the Transportation Security Administration will compare passenger data with names on two government watch lists: a "no-fly" list comprises known or suspected terrorists, and a "watch" list names people who should face tighter scrutiny before boarding planes.

The flight was diverted to Bangor, in the northeastern state of Maine, late Saturday, said Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman Yolanda Clark.

Ask Loeffler and his bandmates/siblings Sam and Pete to list the music that influenced the band's sound, and they'll list Helmet, Tool, Sinead O'Connor and Yusuf Islam -- the artist once known as Cat Stevens and most recently in the news as being on the United State's no-fly list for alleged ties to terrorism, an accusation the artist vehemently denies.

Oberman said the TSA will present the final plan for Secure Flight early next year.

"People are hungry for some sort of attitude and guidance through an ocean of spin," he said.

He said he was bound for Nashville to "initiate some recordings."

Ronan asked him to do the duet and he said yes."

Cat Stevens, who abandoned his music career when he converted to Islam and changed his name to Yusuf Islam 30 years ago, is making a surprise comeback with a single that could top the charts at Christmas.

Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Thursday that Britain would not pay a ransom or meet any political demands to secure Bigley's release.

British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw complained Wednesday to U.S. officials about their treatment of Islam, telling U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell "that this action should not have been taken," the Foreign Office said.

Puzzled and angry at being barred from the United States, Yusuf Islam, the singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, returned to London vowing to find out why.

A second government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S. authorities think donations from Islam may have ended up helping to fund blind sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, convicted for a plot to bomb New York City landmarks, and Hamas, a Palestinian militant group considered a terrorist organization by the United States.

Time magazine reported that Islam's deportation was caused by a spelling mixup over the name of "Yusuf Islam" on his passport and a certain "Youssouf Islam" who is on US watch lists.

"Secure Flight represents a significant step in securing domestic air travel and safeguarding national security information, namely, the watchlists," the TSA said in a notice announcing the order.

For his part Rocca said he considered his satirical bits a kind of public service.

"We want the airlines to be more diligent about doing the checks," US Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security Asa Hutchinson said after a meeting with EU officials.

The British government said more than 100,000 leaflets had been distributed in Baghdad containing a personal plea from Bigley's family and an appeal to his captors to release him.

Justin Oberman, who heads the TSA office that's developing Secure Flight, said the agency will set up a passenger advocate's office to handle complaint from passengers.

The agency said, however, it will test the passenger information "on a very limited basis" against commercial data.

Barry Steinhardt, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer, said a major problem is the lists include the names of many people who are not security risks.

The lists are "a hodgepodge of information, accurate and inaccurate," Steinhardt said.

On Friday, Michael Hoyt, the executive editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, said that in some ways Stewart was providing a counterbalance to the conservatism of the Fox News Channel.

The form of news satire on "The Daily Show" is more sophisticated, mocking not just the style of the news but the conventions of journalism; for example, the mainstream news media's fixation with fairness.

"When I got out of school everyone wanted to write for sitcoms," Borowitz said.

"A well-told joke that has a Republican target, if it's clever enough, gets Republicans to laugh too," Rocca said.

US authorities on Monday urged airlines to step up their passenger security checks, after a Washington-bound Air France flight from Paris was diverted when US officials learned that a passenger was in their "no-fly" list.

US authorities asked that the Boeing 777 carrying 263 people be diverted to Bangor, in the northeastern state of Maine, late Saturday after discovering that a passenger was on the list of people deemed a security risk.

The Boeing 777 had 263 passengers on board, an Air France spokeswoman said.

They contained messages from Bigley's family and from prominent British Muslims, including Yusuf Islam, the singer once known as Cat Stevens.

Islam's United Airlines flight to Dulles International Airport was diverted to Maine's Bangor International Airport when U.S. officials reviewing the passenger list discovered he was aboard.

"Young people get the attitude, the deflationary truth-telling attitude of these shows because they can't find it elsewhere," he said.

"This is big because there is this gigantic imbalance and something has got to fill it," said the cultural critic Neal Gabler, who is obsessed with "The Daily Show."

"Television newscasts are so calcified and rigid, any departure from that is exhilarating," he said.

There are no women detained there," said Rana Sidani at the ICRC in Geneva, Switzerland.

U.S. authorities provided few details about Islam's alleged connection to terrorism or when he was added to the watch list.

Hutchinson recalled that US authorities were preparing to test a new system dubbed "Secure Flight" that will allow them to compare the list of passengers with the no-fly list.

An airline industry representative said the carriers support the government's goals but remain wary of privacy concerns.

"U.S. airlines have long-standing concerns that center on privacy and operational issues," said James May, president of the Air Transport Association, which represents major airlines.

The singer, who gave up his successful pop career in the late 1970s and converted to Islam, was deported back to Britain after being denied entry into the United States on security concerns.

"It's not only a label we didn't want, it's untrue," Joe Loeffler, bassist and vocalist, said by phone recently.

The singer, who gave up his successful pop career in the late 1970s and converted to Islam, was deported back to Britain after being denied entry into the United States on "security grounds."

The Foreign Office said Friday that leaflets had been distributed in the streets around 28 mosques in Baghdad.

As for the Pew study crediting shows like his for teaching a fifth of young Americans about politics, Karlin said he was dubious.

He was joined at the event by British music stars Annie Lennox, Brian May from the group Queen, Peter Gabriel and Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens.

Comedy Central mocked CNN's motto -- "The most trusted name in news" -- and Walter Cronkite's onetime reputation (as America's most trusted man) on a billboard during the Republican National Convention, which proclaimed "The Daily Show" as "the most trusted name in fake news."

The television era has produced a steady supply of news spoofs like "Not Necessarily the News," "That Was the Week That Was" and "Weekend Update" on "Saturday Night Live."

The hyped-up news cycle has been a boon to the fake news racket.

And in a strange turnabout, mainstream news outlets have been clamoring to introduce news satire to their programming, never mind that mainstream news is often what is being mocked.

In September, the British musician was expelled from the United States after authorities diverted his London-to-Washington flight to Maine to remove him, saying he was suspected of ties to terrorism.

"My favorite artist, probably because of her stability, in doing what she tries to do record after record, is Enya," said Joe Loeffler, 24.

Sidani said the ICRC did not have any contacts with the militant group, controlled by Jordanian terror mastermind Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, believed to be holding Bigley.

Under Secure Flight, the government would take responsibility for checking passengers.

Islam was deported from the United States last month after being denied entry on "security grounds" and was released without charge.

"Today I spent an hour on Court TV talking about the Peterson case, and I don't know anything about the Peterson case," Borowitz said on Wednesday.

News satire of course is a time-tested gag.

He added that the number of people barred from entering the United States has sharply increased.

All of which begs the question: What are programs like "Larry King Live" and "Prime Time Live" hoping to accomplish by bringing news satirists on board?

Although he is coy about his politics, Stewart seems to relish mocking conservatives more than liberals, and at his studio on Thursday night, the crowd of people in their 20s, divided almost evenly between men and women, made no secret of their distaste for President Bush while watching the debate on monitors before the show began.

As Cat Stevens, Islam enjoyed a string of hits including "Wild World" and "Moonshadow."

Homeland Security spokesman Brian Doyle would only say that the intelligence community has recently obtained information that "further heightens concern" about Islam.

They are pieces of the same puzzle."

"We are not actual newspeople."

"I don't have opinions.

That, and passion.

It was not clear whether Straw meant Islam's detention, or his inclusion on the watch list.

The ABC news magazine "Prime Time Live" recently began closing the program with a two-minute musical rendition of satirical headlines.

Let down, perhaps, by the mainstream media, 21 percent of people under 30 say they are learning about the campaign from satirical sources like "The Daily Show" and the late-night television monologues, up from 9 percent in 2000, according to a Pew Research Center study released in January.

Gabler said, "It's a form of humor that subverts media convention and reveals the pomposities and idiocies of politicians, but even more the pomposities and idiocies of the media that covers the politicians."

The government ordered U.S. airlines Friday to turn over personal information about passengers so it can test a system for identifying potential terrorists.

Islam has known Keating, a former member of Boyzone, for a decade.

Islam, who was traveling with his 21-year-old daughter, Maymanah, told reporters in London he was treated well by FBI agents.

Once they have the audience's sympathies, fake news purveyors have a simple task: be funny.

Midway through live analysis of the presidential debate on "The Daily Show" on Thursday night, the host, Jon Stewart, called on his "correspondents" in the field for some in-depth analysis.

There still is no formal way for people mistakenly identified as terrorists, or who have the same name as a suspected terrorist, to get off the lists.

On one fake newscast, Stewart asked a correspondent in the field for his opinion on the Swift Boat veterans claims against Sen. John Kerry.

"It's perfectly appropriate on mainstream news shows now to have a satirist in the mix."

Islam has denied supporting terrorist organisations.

Besides "The Daily Show," Ali G uses the news talk show format to absurd ends, mocking politicians, celebrities and panels of self-proclaimed experts.

The humorist Andy Borowitz files daily stories in perfect news-service deadpan on his Web site, www.BorowitzReport.com.

And, don't mistake the trio for "Christian rockers," as critics and industry execs in the past have tried to tag them.

Mo Rocca, formerly of "The Daily Show," played the role of wisecracking on-air correspondent for "Larry King Live" during the political conventions.

According to his Web site, the singer was last in the United States two months ago with his record company.

"Fox supplies it in one way, and Jon Stewart in another.

Fake news is certainly the comic trope of the moment.

Yusuf Islam, 56, who sold 50 million records in the 1960s and 1970s, has recorded a version of his 1970 hit "Father and Son" with Ronan Keating, the Irish former boy-band star, The Times newspaper reported Thursday.

"If we did not have this position there would be many, many more people who would be kidnapped, and the world would be less safe," Straw told British Broadcasting Corp. television.

Mandela has lent his prison number 46664 to AIDS campaigns, for the first time last November at the rock concert in Cape Town.

The TSA says Secure Flight differs from the previous plan because it does not compare personal data with commercial databases.

"This book is a record of that amazing night... that raised awareness and inspired the fight against AIDS," the Nobel peace prize winner told a London audience.

For one thing, there is a steady flow of new material.

Mark Twain wrote fake news stories, and they were a staple of The National Lampoon in the 1970s.

People within the commercial aviation industry say there are more than 100,000 names on the lists.

The government's first attempt was scuttled because of fears the government would have access to too much personal information.

The flight landed in Maine at 5:30 pm (2000 GMT) and headed back to Washington's Dulles International Airport two hours later, Clark added.

The International Committee of the Red Cross insisted Friday that Britain does not hold any women prisoners in Iraq, although the demand of militants holding a British man hostage is that female prisoners be freed.

Under the current system, the government shares parts of the watchlists with airlines, which are responsible for making sure suspected terrorists don't get on planes.

Of course no self-respecting satirist would take credit for anything so profound as affecting the political discourse, or even to having a political point of view.
