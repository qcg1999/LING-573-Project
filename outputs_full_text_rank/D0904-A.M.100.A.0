Organizers said they were demonstrating against black gangs they said were harassing white residents.

said White, 29.

"We were protesting black racial violence against white people  in that neighborhood," said White.

Rybczynski said.

"I definitely think they should allow white people in as members," Campfield said.

He said the white supremacists had left hours earlier.

``There are black people who share the beliefs of white supremacists and who, by their actions, concede that white people hold the keys to everything we are and can become,'' he said in a telephone interview.

The neo-Nazi group, known as "America's Nazi Party," said they came to the city because of a dispute between neighbors, one white and the other black.

He said the book was also meant to appeal to white supremacists.

Other neighbors said the group had a right to have their say.

At one point, the crowd reached 600 people, officials said.

"Today of all days, to have white supremacists come here from Arkansas, is most disappointing," he said.

"People just started going crazy about it," Campfield said.

Molloy said the Chicago police also had stopped its practice of sending cars to her home for additional patrols, and Lefkow, her daughter, said the authorities had long ago removed the security cameras it had installed in their home.

I wish we could," Brooks said.

A crowd protesting a white supremacists' march turned violent, throwing baseball-sized rocks at police, vandalizing vehicles and stores, and setting fire to a neighborhood bar, authorities said.

A white Republican lawmaker who contends he was excluded from a Black legislative group solely because of his race said Tuesday that the group is even more racist than the Ku Klux Klan.

Bob White, leader of the movement, said police forced his group  to disband after the protestors gathered around them and began to  throw stones.

He acknowledged the group's bylaws mention only black lawmakers but said it might consider admitting a white lawmaker _ not necessarily Campfield who is "using this as a joke."

A Sheehan spokesman said the white supremacists were not invited by anyone connected with Cindy Sheehan.

White supremacists, he said, "have more of a tendency to word of mouth, to say, 'Hey, you ought to pick this up.'"

"It's exactly what they wanted," Ford said of the group that planned the march, which was canceled because of the rioting.

He said people in the crowd swore at him and wanted to know why he was protecting the Nazis.

If the Nazi group tries to come back, Ford said he would seek a court order to stop them.

Local and federal law enforcement officials said on Tuesday that they were investigating possible connections between the double murder and Matthew Hale, the white supremacist currently in federal prison for soliciting Lefkow's assassination, or his many sympathizers.

When Evola said, "Consider it done," Hale responded, "Good."

Tennessee Black Caucus member Rep. Larry Miller, a Democrat, said no white lawmaker has ever asked to join.

Two people were arrested during Sunday's confrontation, officer John Boyle said.

"Too bad the people couldn't ignore them," said Dee Huntley.

"It doesn't have anything to do with hate," Reid said.

"She wasn't afraid," Sycamore said of the judge.

He said the city wouldn't give the Nazi group a permit to march in the streets but couldn't stop them from walking on the sidewalks.

Doug Hanks said the postings were fictional and designed to win white supremacists' trust as he researched a novel he was writing.

Police began receiving word midweek from officers on the street that gangs were going to descend on the neighborhood in protest, the police chief said.

"Then he asked her out for a beer, and she said maybe coffee."

Much of the anger boiled over because people were upset that city leaders were willing to allow the supremacists to walk through the neighborhood and shout insults, residents and authorities said.

"If this march had occurred in downtown Toledo, we wouldn't have had the unrest," he said.

Experts on race and hate groups said Campfield hit a nerve when he used King's words to take on a black institution.

About 200 officers patrolled the neighborhood overnight after the riot, Navarre said.

"Very typically these days we see white supremacists, hate groups, trying to use the words of King and other civil rights leaders to try to advance their agendas," Potok said.

Police said Shireen Chambers, 36, of Boston, who is white, struck a black man, Jerome Higins, 25, of Everett, and he retaliated by spitting in her face and hitting her with a sign.

In one June 1 posting, he said blacks should be treated like "rabid beasts."

Navarre said the riots escalated because members of the National Socialist Movement took their protest to the neighborhood, which is predominantly black, instead of a neutral place.

Still, Anderson said, "they are clearly tied to the white supremacist movement, if you look at the types of merchandise they're offering.

He had earlier said he wanted to join the group to find out how it spends its money.

There was a report of a shooting but police hadn't found a victim, Police Chief Mike Navarre said.

It's the same tactic white separatists often use, said Mark Potok, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Hale said that he prefers to "fight within the law" but "if you wish to, ah, do anything yourself, you can, you know?"

"They do have a right to walk on the Toledo sidewalks," said Mayor Jack Ford, who at one point confronted leaders of the mob and tried to settle them down.

"I was chagrined that there were obvious mothers and children in the crowd with them," he said.

A gang member in a mask threatened to shoot him, and others cursed him for allowing the march, the mayor said.

"You can't allow people to come challenge a whole city and not think they weren't going to strike back," said Kenneth Allen, 47, who watched the violence begin near his home.

Bailey said, however, that the FBI can do little because the business is not breaking the law.

But it's not Bennett, whose comments illuminated a moral inconsistency in black America that is far more harmful than anything he said.

"We knew during the preparation that it was going to be a tremendous challenge," Police Chief Mike Navarre said Sunday.

At least 65 people were arrested on charges including assault, vandalism, failure to obey police and failure to disperse, Navarre said.

Authorities said there was little they could do to stop the group, because they did not apply for a parade permit and instead planned to walk along sidewalks.

He said he didn't know if the man who threatened him was actually armed, but he blamed gangs for much of the violence.

"An outstanding product real skinheads can be proud to be associated with," one wearer said in a review on the Aryan Wear Web site.

Thomas Frisch, 76, said a large group of men destroyed the exterior of a gas station next to his home of 30 years.

But a local politician said that the multi-ethnic neighborhood  was not particularly beset by violence.

The violence broke out after a group of nearly 80 white  supremacists of the Virigina-based National Socialist Movement  assembled for a march against what they called black gang violence  against whites in the Toledo neighborhood.

James Molloy, the Chicago Police Department's chief of detectives, said the murders happened between 10:30 a.m., when Lefkow's mother answered a telephone call from one of her granddaughters, and 5:30 p.m. when the judge returned home.

Several officers and firefighters suffered minor injuries, Navarre said.

Then they started on the building, breaking windows, ripping the bars off," he said.

When Mayor Jack Ford and a local minister tried to calm the rioting Saturday, they were cursed for allowing the march, and Ford said a masked gang member threatened to shoot him.

"They don't have the right to bring hate to my front yard," said Terrance Anderson, who lives near a bar that was destroyed.

Initially, Roy said, the boots were sold to make money for the National Alliance.

Boyle said at least one officer was injured while arresting Chambers, who yelled racist epithets as she was dragged away.

"I think she's very upset with herself, maybe, for being a judge and putting her family in this danger," said Laura Lefkow, 20, the third of the judge's five daughters, "but there's no way she should have known."

Federal officials in Washington said agents were scrubbing Lefkow's entire caseload in search of suspects, with the main thrust on the hate groups that had targeted her before.

``At health fairs, when I ask our young people what are their top health concerns, they say, 'To go to school or a party and not get shot,' '' Davis said.

A man identifying himself as Jim Reid, who lives near Austin, said in a recent telephone interview that Eynon is no longer associated with Aryan Wear and that he is the new president and chief executive officer.

"We frankly could have made a couple hundred arrests easily," Navarre said.

They would be asked to leave if they set foot at Camp Casey II, which is on private property, the spokesman said.

Mitt Romney, who attended the Faneuil Hall event, said he was disgusted by the presence of the supremacists.

"I guess because the FBI felt it seemed like there was no danger," said Laura Lefkow, a sophomore at Pomona College in Southern California.

Potok, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Hale's organization splintered and foundered upon his arrest, shrinking from a high in the 1990s of 88 chapters to just five in 2003, but jumped to at least 16 chapters last year and remains one of the nation's most violent groups.

"There is much speculation about possible links between this crime and the possible involvement of hate groups," he said at a news conference.

``Traditional African education focused on integrity, and we need to refocus on that,'' Coppock said.

Marshal's service, said that Lefkow had a special protective detail for "a couple of weeks" last year, but it was disbanded when the threats against her were deemed "not viable."

I think this pretty much seals the deal," said a phone message left at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram by Tony Eynon, who is named as Aryan Wear's president and lone director in corporate records filed with the Texas secretary of state's office in Austin.

They were mostly "gang members who had real or imagined grievances and took it as an opportunity to speak in their own way," Ford said.

The march had been called off because of the crowds, and the white supremacists had left.

On the Internet, a forum posting from the Stormfront White Nationalist Community urged white supremacists to come to Crawford this weekend to speak out against the war.

Lori Bailey, a spokeswoman for the FBI in North Texas, said federal authorities are "keenly aware" of Aryan Wear because of its apparent association with the sometimes violent skinhead movement.

"We saw what happened the last time Matt Hale got slapped in the face by the system: The price of that was two dead and nine severely wounded," said Mark Potok, director of intelligence for the Southern Poverty Law Center.

"I think anytime anybody deals in that type of activity, it's a concern for law enforcement," Anderson said.

Joe Roy, chief researcher for the law center's magazine, the Intelligence Report, called Aryan Wear a "hate-for-profit" business, a kind of one-stop shopping for the fashion needs of white supremacists."

Roy said the boots were created by Eynon's friend Christopher Evans, who was connected with the violence-prone Confederate Hammerskins in Dallas and now lives in the Fort Worth area.

"He's a man of total inner hatred in both his heart and soul, and it doesn't matter what party he's in," McCrory said.

Hanks had filed papers seeking the Republican nomination for one of four at-large council seats, but formally withdrew Friday, said county elections director Michael Dickerson.

"I am more worried about the heat than I am about anyone else out there," Plemons said, referring to triple-digit temperatures on Saturday.

"I'm glad that authorities are aware of this operation and are keeping an eye on it," said Roy Brooks, a leader in the local African-American community and a member of the Tarrant County Commissioners Court.

Keith White, a black resident, criticized city officials for allowing the march in the first place.

In the days leading up to a white supremacist march, ministers pleaded with residents in the predominantly black neighborhood to stay calm and community leaders organized peace rallies.

"We can stand alongside the federal law enforcement community in saying just as they felt a deep regret and sadness over the death of Randy Weaver's family so we also feel a deep sense of regret and sadness over the death of Judge Lefkow's family," Roper said.

Roy said the boots were the alliance's biggest moneymaker until August 2003 when Eynon formed Aryan Wear as a Texas company and began selling the boots exclusively.

At 4 p.m., the Lefkows' youngest daughter, Margaret, 16, came home to get her gym bag and left without seeing anyone in the house, Molloy said.

Jules P. Harrell, a professor and acting chairman of Howard's Department of Psychology, said African-Americans need to ``cultivate a new sense of body,'' one rooted in health and self-respect and not in popular culture, such as rap music videos.

Chief Deputy Randy Plemons said they don't plan to change their standard game plan, which has mostly worked.

Beth Sycamore, a publishing consultant who lives three houses away, said the Lefkows strolled the neighborhood, holding hands, and took the el train even amid the death threats.

Hiram Grau, the department's deputy superintendent, said: "The questions you have are the same ones we have and we are working around the clock to get them answered."

Although Campfield said he still believes the blog is a good idea, it will now carry only his posts, along with a little biographical information _ such as his interests in judo and karate, and a listing of the Bible as his favorite book.

Billy Roper, a friend of Hale's who is chairman of a group called White Revolution, disavowed the violence but offered a different parallel: the FBI's 1992 confrontation in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, with the white separatist Randall C. Weaver, whose wife and 14-year-old son wound up dead.

Neighbors in Denver said she played Solitaire and Scrabble on a computer and frequently cooked big meals for friends.

For Joan Humphrey Lefkow, the nightmare began shortly after her 2000 appointment as a federal judge, when an Oregon group's lawsuit to block white supremacists from using a name it had trademarked, World Church of the Creator, landed in her lap.

Federal officials refused to discuss the restrictions, but his mother, Evelyn Hutcheson, said that she and his father are the only people he is allowed contact with, and that they are limited to 15-minute phone calls each Thursday morning, and separate hourlong visits twice a month.

No one at the conference jumped up to blame the white man.

"He had nothing to do with what went on last night," Hutcheson said in a telephone interview from her home in East Peoria, Ill. "My son is sitting in a hole where he's not allowed to even speak loud enough to be audible.

Lefkow said that her father, a former cab driver, bus driver and substitute teacher, sought out the local courthouse, post office and Episcopal church wherever he went, because he saw them as the "pillars of society."

"Riots, like grass fire, start from the smallest little spark," said Bill Johnson, who owns the Yellow Rose, a prominent gift shop at Crawford's main intersection.

She was immediately vilified -- Hal Turner, an underground radio personality, said on his show that she was "worthy of being killed," adding that "it wouldn't be legal but in my opinion it wouldn't be wrong."

There are three "primary" owners, in Houston, Florida and New Jersey, and the new owners want to remain "silent partners," Reid said.

Hanks said his self-published novel, called "Patriot Act," takes themes from "The Turner Diaries" _ the racist novel believed to have inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

``Our health is our responsibility,'' said Jackson L. Davis III, a urologist and coordinator of men's health initiatives at the D.C. Department of Health.

Outside, 10 to 15 members of the Arkansas-based group White Revolution were escorted by officers to a designated protest area across the street.

The reviewed called the boots "Too White ...!"

Soon, Lefkow found her home address and family photographs posted along with violent threats on hate-filled Websites, and last April, one of the Aryan movement's most notorious leaders was convicted of plotting her murder.

Rioting erupted Saturday in an  impoverished neighborhood of Toledo, Ohio after hundreds of  counter-protestors broke up a planned march by a neo-Nazi group,  Toledo police confirmed.

"I was shaking.

"If it was the case that someone was misguided and thought that they were helping Matt Hale, then it would be similar in that other people had suffered for one person's mistake."

At least two dozen members of the National Socialist Movement, which calls itself "America's Nazi Party," had gathered at a city park to march under police protection.

That is, until Bennett spoke of aborting ``black babies,'' and suddenly those fetuses become precious pre-born black people who must be saved from the evil Dr. Bill.

Campfield posted a message on his Web journal, or blog, last week about his unsuccessful attempt to join the black lawmakers' group.

One group of men pounded on a convenience store, and others overturned vehicles.

At least 65 people were arrested and several police officers were injured before calm was restored about four hours later.

However, the potential appearance of white supremacists and the planned Sunday visit of activist and former presidential candidate Rev.

Aryan Wear, an online clothing, music and book outlet that opposes Jews and promotes white supremacy, keeps much of its merchandise in the storage stall near Fort Worth.

Hale, who called himself Pontifex Maximus of the church that at one point claimed 30,000 members, was arrested in January 2003, after an FBI informant infiltrated the church to become his security chief.

Already, some white supremacists were celebrating the killings on the Internet, while others spun conspiracy theories that the crime was committed by Hale's enemies to poison the atmosphere before his sentencing next month.

He lives with his wife and young child in a well-established neighborhood -- down the street from a black family and a Hispanic family -- in a home no different from any other on the block until, neighbors say, the garage door rises, revealing a large Confederate flag on the wall.

That's 413,760 abortions performed on black women in one year -- or 1,133 a day.

White supremacists clashed with an angry crowd outside Faneuil Hall, where Holocaust survivors and their families were commemorating the liberation of Nazi concentration camps.

To that end, we might welcome the controversy about abortion and black babies and the long-overdue focus it brings to the black womb -- home to hope unbound as well as unspeakable tragedy.

"My understanding is that the KKK doesn't even ban members by race," Rep. Stacey Campfield, a lawmaker from Knoxville, told The Associated Press, adding that the KKK "has less racist bylaws" than the black lawmakers' group.

Incorporated by Fort Worth man, Aryan Wear is one of 10 hate and racially intolerant operations in Dallas-Fort Worth, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is based in Montgomery, Ala., and tracks extremist groups.

"Everyone associated with the Matt Hale trial has deserved assassination for a long time," reads an Internet essay posted on Tuesday by Bill White, editor of the Libertarian Socialist News.

Authorities even delayed releasing the route so protesters wouldn't know where the group planned to march.

In drumming up support for these actions, one e-mailer called Bennett a racist and eugenicist and declared, ``That's how Hitler got started.''

``You could abort every black baby in this country, and the crime rate would go down.''

Scores of rioters rampaged through streets wrecking cars and  setting a building on fire in north Toledo after police fired tear  gas on the anti-Nazi group.

But after an appeals court reversed her decision, Lefkow had little choice but to order Hale to remove the World Church name from his Web sites and printed material or face fines of $1,000 per day.

The violence broke out about one-quarter of a mile away along the planned march route shortly before it was to begin.

It wasn't enough to stop an angry mob that included gang members from looting and burning a neighborhood bar, smashing the windows of a gas station and hurling rocks and bottles at police on Saturday.

"I did what I thought I needed to do to establish myself as a credible white nationalist."

Joan Lefkow, a magistrate judge since 1982, was appointed to the U.S. District Court by President Clinton, and originally ruled in favor of Hale, dismissing the trademark case, in 2002.

The informant, Anthony Evola, provided an e-mail message in which Hale sought Lefkow's home address, and a tape recording of them discussing her fate.

A city council candidate dropped out of the race Friday after it was disclosed that he posted comments to a white supremacist Internet bulletin board more than 4,000 times.

Experts who have spent years tracking Hale's organization -- now called Creativity -- also pointed to the upcoming sentencing, noting that one of his acolytes, Benjamin Smith, went on a shooting spree in 1999 after Hale was rejected by the Illinois bar.

So do the Tarrant County Sheriff's Department and a national watchdog group that monitors hate groups nationwide.

But on Monday night, federal marshals met Laura Lefkow's plane from Los Angeles, and they stood guard on Tuesday as the family planned Saturday funerals for Michael F. Lefkow, 64, an attorney who was a leader in the Episcopal church, and Donna Humphrey, 89, an ailing grandmother who hand-stitched quilts for each of her 23 descendants.

The disturbances were confined to a 1-square-mile (2.6-square-kilometer) area, but the crowd swelled to about 600 people, overwhelming police.

So far, only two people have been arrested in connection with disturbances at the peace camp protest site.

Two people were charged with disturbing the peace after a scuffle outside the protest area.

Atiba Coppock, an educational psychologist based in the District, called on black men to assume their responsibilities as husbands and fathers and suggested new ways to build character in our black boys.

Finally, police marched shoulder-to-shoulder down the street shouting to people to stay inside, and the crowd of several hundred broke up.

In a small industrial park west of Keller, Texas, near sprawling neighborhoods and new schools, a storage facility routinely receives shipments of merchandise geared toward a certain clientele -- white supremacists and anti-Semites.

A spokesman for the National Socialist Movement blamed police for losing control of the situation.

He spoke at a recent health conference for black men at Howard University.

Earlier this year, Campfield was promptly rebuffed when he inquired about joining the Black Caucus.

Sheehan has vowed to keep vigil near the president's vacation home until he agrees to meet with her to discuss bringing an end to the Iraq war.

Sheriff's deputies have depended on some level of self-policing by holding individual leaders responsible for groups of people.

The officers, many in riot gear, formed a barricade between the protesters and about 100 people who angrily shouted at them to leave Boston.

Hundreds of peace and pro-Bush demonstrators are expected to pack Crawford and the areas near President Bush's ranch house over the weekend.

Hale, who is representing himself, faces up to 40 years in prison, and has been held for two years in the Metropolitan Correctional Center here under special administrative measures, reserved for terrorists, that limited contact with the outside world.
