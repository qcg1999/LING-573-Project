If you don't get plastic bags with your groceries, then you would have to buy plastic bags.

"Everybody I know uses plastic grocery bags for garbage bags.

He said he expected the ban on plastic bags to be effected  later this year.

Shestek, the American Plastics Council spokesman, said some of the costs attributed to plastic bags could be recouped by sending plastic bag waste to companies that can use it as a raw material, such as decking and composite lumber producers.

Mugisha said a ban on plastic bags is among proposals aimed at  reducing the use of polythene, adding that but the tax imposed on  the plastic bags about two years ago has not helped in restricting their use because their price is still very low.

"The animals were eating the plastic bags and dying," Wolde  said.

My column explained that the San Francisco Department of the Environment came up with the 17 cents by dividing the environmental cost of used grocery bags ($8.5 million annually) by the estimated number of plastic and paper bags distributed in San Francisco supermarkets each year (50 million).

He points to the success in Ireland, where use of plastic bags dropped by 90 percent a year after the nation imposed a fee of 15 cents per bag.

"I'm skeptical that the plastics industry is going to be capable of coming up with a solution that involves fewer numbers of plastic bags being sold," said Mark Murray, executive director of Californians Against Waste, which has pushed San Francisco and Los Angeles authorities to consider fee-per-bag systems.

Sources blamed the delay in  effecting the decision on ban the manufacture and importation of  plastic bags on the lack of political will and protecting those  who have invested heavily in plastic bags.

Rwanda imposed a ban on the manufacture and importation of  polythene bags last year, while the United Nations Environment  Program is working with the Kenyan government to ban plastic bags  there in a new waste management strategy.

By August  that year, shoppers had already cut the use of plastic bags by 90  percent, the environment ministry announced.

In Ireland, for example, there is anecdotal evidence of increased shoplifting as people bring in their own bags and higher sales of boxes of plastic bags, which consumers use for everything from pet waste to trash cans.

Right now only about 5 percent of the plastic used in grocery bags is recycled.

The San Francisco proposal parallels efforts in Ireland, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai and Taiwan, which ban plastic bags or charge a fee to use them.

He said that the NEMA had made recommendations to the cabinet  to ban the plastic bags about five years ago.

"My native Germany charges a fee for these bags, and people respond in the best way for the environment -- they bring their own tote bags!

Uganda will soon ban the  manufacture and importation of plastic bags and impose a hefty  levy on thicker ones, an environment official has said.

The $8.5 million is the departments' estimate of what it costs the city to sweep up and dispose of bags, plus what it costs Norcal Waste Systems to remove plastic bags from its recycling and composting system.

"Maybe we'll come up with a fine or a tax for the plastic bags, and give the bag some value, so people will think twice before throwing it on the streets."

Point of interest: When Ireland imposed a 15-cent charge on all plastic shopping bags in 2002, it exempted a number of bags, including those that hold raw meat.

City officials are considering charging grocery stores 17 cents each for grocery bags to discourage use of plastic sacks.

"We've been trained to want bags," she said.

Kagame who participated in the clean-up of the Kigali city said that his government had endorsed the ban on all plastic bags and anyone who still owns them ought to face penalties.

The city's Department of the Environment estimates San Francisco customers bring home about 50 million bags each year.

Plastics make up more than half of all the trash in the river, and plastic bags alone constitute slightly more than one-third of the litter.

"People have already forgotten about plastic bags, they've moved  on to other things," quipped one Eritrean.

Since January, "those who import, produce, distribute or sell  plastic bags are fined," said Wolde Yohannes, the head of  environment wing in the ministry of land, water and environment.

"Instead of making our life more complicated by charging for shopping bags, why don't we start with something that is more of a luxury, such as Diaper Genie," which wraps dirty disposable diapers in plastic bags.

Engineer Neil Lillemark says the city's calculation ignores two facts: Some of the 50 million bags distributed each year get reused and don't go immediately into the waste stream, and a fee would cut bag consumption (and thus the city's costs).

Maathai, who serves as Kenya's deputy environment minister,  pledged to push the Kenyan government to adopt measures to reduce  the use of plastic bags.

While in Europe, Ireland introduced a similar bid to cut down  the use of plastic bags in March 2002, then dubbed a "plastax".

The government announced that the funds raised from a tax on  plastic bags would be used for an office for environment  enforcement, implementing a national waste prevention programme and  the disposal of fridges and freezers.

Some grocery stores have bins in which to deposit used bags, and some offer a discount -- 5 cents or less -- for shoppers who bring their own bags.

Uganda is one of the few countries in the Great Lakes region  where plastic bags are not regulated.

One even sent me a photo of her kitchen recycling center, rigged to hold plastic bags.

The proposal, set to be considered by the Commission on the Environment on Tuesday, imitates efforts around the world to stem the use of plastic bags -- known in China as "white pollution."

According to the Department of the Environment, consumers lug home about 50 million bags from San Francisco grocery stores each year.

We also make sure the plastic bags we buy come primarily from recycled materials."

The bags account for 2 percent of the city's total "waste stream," and picking up and disposing littered bags cost an additional $7.4 million annually, according to the report.

Ireland, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai and Taiwan are just a few of the places where the government either bans plastic bags outright or charges a fee to use them.

Yet there is a demand for the raw material by companies that use old sacks to make more bags or plastic building materials.

But the fee would also apply to paper bags to help reduce overall waste.

The state-run Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and  Analysis (KIPPRA) and National Environmental Management Authority  (NEMA) said at least two million plastic bags a year were being  distributed to shoppers in Nairobi alone, many of which were not  disposed of properly.

City officials are considering charging grocery stores 17 cents apiece for the bags, 90 percent of which are plastic -- and are blamed by environmentalists for everything from clogging recycling machines to killing marine life and suffocating infants.

The Rwandan government has launched a national war against plastic bags as an attempt to maintain the environment and clean up the country, President Paul Kagame told reporters Monday.

Reyes' proposal to create a task force on plastic bags will likely go to the full City Council next week after being approved Wednesday by the council's Environmental Quality and Waste Management Committee.

Plastic bags also clog the screens installed on storm drains that filter trash from runoff.

Discarded plastic bags "provide several million habitats for  mosquitoes to breed that increase the risk of malaria," she said,  noting that the disease was a leading cause of infant mortality in  Kenya and throughout Africa.

A report prepared in support of the proposal by Robert Haley, recycling program manager for the environment department, says plastic bags gum up recycling and composting machines at Norcal -- San Francisco's waste management provider -- resulting in $1 million in extra costs and lost revenue from the sale of recyclable materials.

Individuals are not fined if they are caught with a plastic bag.

Although the environmentalists are not as concerned about the effect of recyclable paper bags on the environment, the proposal would include them, too, with the idea of reducing waste in general.

Others have even forgotten that plastic bags did exist and  littered their streets and trash-dumbing zones, just before  January.

"We have now resorted to using newspapers as packing bags until the government shows us what to be used," one businessman in the capital city Kigali said.

It's probably faster to use a lot of bags instead of trying to figure out how to make the best use of each bag, but it's so wasteful," says Sarah Stockton of Daly City.

I've gotten more than 70 e-mails responding to my Tuesday column about the San Francisco Commission on the Environment's resolution urging the Board of Supervisors to force supermarkets in the city to charge shoppers 17 cents apiece for bags.

It really has dramatically reduced the level of plastic bag waste all over the country," writes Ray Walsh.

The plant is expected to start operating in May this year, with the capacity of recycling every day about 10 tons of plastic bags, bottles and other industrial waste from collection centers.

According to the proposal, grocers would be able to keep half of the fee and would be expected to spend it on city-approved programs, such as discounted reusable shopping bags.

"We don't burn them, factories which make plastic use them for  other purposes," said Wolde.

It notes that an estimated 12 million barrels of oil go into the production of plastic bags, while 14 million trees are felled to make their paper counterparts.

More than 90 percent of consumers choose plastic bags, which are blamed for everything from clogging recycling machines to killing marine life and suffocating infants.

The abandoned plastic bags and containers can be spotted in many towns, blamed for clogging sewage and drainage  systems.

As animals were dying and drainage getting choked before the law  came into force, some areas around Asmara used to be covered by a  sea of coloured plastic bags.

And bags can't be mixed with curbside recyclables.

Though Reyes champions the partnership with industry and the community now, he said he is open to tougher means to get bags out of the Los Angeles River.

Kenya is being swamped with a flood of  discarded plastic shopping bags that pose a growing public health  risk and should take steps to ban the popular lould be banned and a hefty levy  slapped on thicker ones to rid Kenya of an increasing environmental  and health menace,"  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)  said.

Earlier this week, Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki told UNEP  officials that his government would address the problem posed by the  bags but Maathai said she wanted action now.

Some readers suggested it would be more economically efficient to ban free bags, but to allow grocers to sell them for those who forget or choose not to use their own.

"For about eight years, I have reused bags many times because I want to do my part for our environment.

"The bags used to clog the drainage pipes.

LOS ANGELES - Paper or plastic?

Mark Westlund, spokesman for the environment department, said the 17-cent fee is not set in stone, and if a bag fee went into effect, a reduction in taxes and/or garbage fees "certainly could be on the table."

Some say the proposal doesn't go far enough, that fees should apply to other stores and bags.

All sides agree that plastic bags are a blight on the Los Angeles River, where hundreds of white sacks float on the shallow water, stick to rocks and dangle like Spanish moss from tree branches.

"We are banning polythene bags and it is a matter of time for  them to become history," Mugisha said on Sunday in Nairobi, Kenya  where he is heading a NEMA delegation.

Seventeen times in one month meant that 17 bags were not sent to the dump!"

Of those, 90 percent are nonrecyclable plastic.

In addition to exacerbating the mosquito problem, plastic bags  block gutters and drains, choke farm animals and marine wildlife,  pollute the soil, can ruin Kenya's dramatic natural vistas and can  take 20 to 1,000 years to decompose.

In San Francisco, the free grocery bag soon might go the way of the full-service gas station.

"The bag manufacturers in the last few years have gotten together and realize there is an issue," said Donna Dempsey, executive director of the Film and Bag Federation.

The task force will likely talk about ways to collect and recycle bags.

More than 48 million thin plastic bagsng at a rate of 10 percent per year to  feed massive consumer demand at home and in neighboring countries,  the study said.

San Francisco officials are considering a fee of 17 cents per bag in a bid to encourage Bay Area shoppers to bring their own sacks.

I feel a book coming on: "101 Uses for Old Bags."

The Ugandan government is considering a total ban on polythene bags after a 50 percent excise duty has failed to reduce their production and usage, reported local press on Tuesday.

So far, plastics-industry representatives have said they will participate in Reyes' task force -- particularly in light of the proposed fee in San Francisco, which they oppose.

Mike McHugh fears reusing bags may be unhealthful.

Los Angeles city leaders also want to get rid of grocery-bag blight.

-- Who knows where that bag has been?

He added that the government was still looking at optional measures like controlling importation, production, usage and disposal of polythene bags.

However, "There are retailers who are right now evaluating their clerk and bagger training to (encourage) reduction of bags."

Tanzania is on the way to  handle the increasing plastic waste through establishing a  recycling plant believed to be the first one in east and central  Africa.

Members are virtually certain to consider public-education campaigns to get people to stop littering, to bring their own reusable bags when they shop, and to participate in neighborhood cleanup programs.

Minister of State for Trade Richard Nduhura was quoted as saying that the rampant use of polythene bags has led to environmental disasters like blockage of drainages, suffocation of children and animals and soil degradation.

Parts of Eritrea once littered by a sea  of flimsy shopping bags are being cleaned up thanks to a new law  that entered into force in January to help the Horn of Africa  country protect nature.

"Baggers can be careless, often double bagging for no reason, or putting one or two items in a bag that could have fit into another bag.

Supermarket shoppers could end up paying for selecting either bag if Los Angeles politicians follow a San Francisco proposal -- and the advice of some environmentalists -- to recoup the cost of cleaning up grocery-sack litter.

-- Bad bagger behavior: Several readers said grocers could reduce waste if they simply instructed their baggers to use fewer sacks.

-- The European scene: More than a dozen e-mails came from people who live or have lived in Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Norway or South Africa, where charging for shopping bags is common.

Heidi Melander, president of the Northern California Recycling Association, a supporter of the proposal, said the fee was a tangible way the public can participate in helping reduce waste.

"A new bag is clean!

"What about stores like Walgreens that try to put every little item in a bag -- even if the customer is a woman with a large handbag," writes Beth Wells of San Francisco.

When I came to the U.S. seven years ago, I was astonished (and disgusted) by the practice of using new bags on each trip.

"Plastic is the single most important component of the litter.

Westlund says the city might consider extending bag fees "to other areas like fast foods, drug stores, etc.

But some question whether voluntary, public-private programs will deliver the kind of dramatic cut in plastic litter that is needed for the city of Los Angeles to meet trash regulations.

But we have control over taking that bag."

State legislators defeated a bill last year that would have charged 2 cents on each non-recyclable disposable bag.

Authorities had a raft of reasons for declaring war on the  flimsy bags that not only block gutters and drains, choke farm  animals and marine wildlife, pollute the soil, but also ruin  dramatic natural vistas and can take 20 to 1,000 years to  decompose.

Minister for Industry and Trade Juma Ngasongwa was quoted by  local newspaper Daily News on Thursday as saying that the  Tanzanian government has set aside 1.5 million US dollars to  operate the recycling plant as the first phase of the country's  multi-million-dollar anti-plastic litter project.

Paul Smith, vice president of the California Grocers Association, said the proposal is strongly opposed by the industry group.

San Francisco has a different income group," Reyes said.

"It's gotten out of hand -- everywhere you go, they force them on you, and they think you're weird if you don't take a bag.

The bag might even have previously been used to carry poisonous substances!"

"We have a real problem with plastic and we are linking this with our efforts to protect our rivers and lakes," Mugorewera Drocella, minister of lands and environment told reporters.

While Eritrea has kicked out plastics, a much needed backing  from  anti-plastic campaign rang at UN Environment Programme  governor's meeting in Kenya last week, with Nobel Peace Laureate  Wangari Maathai leading a league to ban the flimsy types.

It has not deterred indiscriminate use of the plastics, prompting us to take drastic measures," Nduhura said at a meeting on plastics waste management and development of environmentally- degradable plastics in Kampala which was attended by delegates from eight African countries.

In the capital Asmara and other outlying regions, the bags have  been replaced by the cotton and nylon and Eritreans have no choice  but to adapt to instead.

Using certain assumptions, he suggests that "10 cents a bag would be a more fair estimate of the charge which should be applied if they were to go this route."

Promoting a healthy environment "means we need to help change people's patterns, and that even means their shopping patterns," said incoming city Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi, who takes office in January.

"If we find that individuals don't cooperate, they could also be  fined," said Kibrom Asmarom, an official in the environment  department.

-- Good question: Ford Kanzler of El Granada writes: "I've often wondered why food markets don't sell reusable cloth bags at the check stand (along with) all the impulse-purchase junk."

They simply have to tell the authorities where they got the bag  from, explained Wolde.

The city's Commission on the Environment will consider the proposal Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the proposal has at least one potential champion on the Board of Supervisors, the newly elected Ross Mirkarimi, who helped found the city's Department of the Environment, which is overseen by the Commission on the Environment.

"We want people to use traditional baskets and give the land a breathing space," Kagame said.

Plastic litter has become an environmental hazard in the east  African country where the public have not been made aware of  disposal methods.

"We all have a responsibility to promote a healthy and sustainable environment, and by doing that, it means we need to help change people's patterns, and that even means their shopping patterns," said Mirkarimi, who will take office in January.

In fact, for one month, I kept count of how many times I reused a single bag.

"Considering the estimated 85,000 dogs in San Francisco, has anyone factored the additional citywide expense in cleaning up poo that people will refuse to pick up in a 17-cent bag three times a day?"

Hoping to avoid drastic measures, Councilman Ed Reyes wants manufacturers of plastics and officials in grocery chains to partner with him on bag cleanups and recycling programs.

Our other general rule is to bag when the forecast is mixed.

And while I have to admit that I easily fell into this behavior myself, the proposed legislation reminded me that bringing my own tote bag is an easy way to be a good citizen of our one and only planet Earth," says Franziska Marks.

City officials were spurred to action by a new mandate to cut trash from the river and from Ballona Creek by 10 percent each year, starting this year, at an estimated cost of $120 million.

"We think essentially it's an unnecessary and misguided approach," said Tim Shestek, spokesman for the American Plastics Council.

An old reused bag cannot guarantee such a situation.

Roughly one-third of these readers love the idea, saying it will cut down on waste and trash.

A spokesman for Mayor Gavin Newsom said the mayor is reviewing it.

It might have held raw meat that may have bled ever so little onto the sides of the bag.

"Here in Los Angeles, I would rather work with the industry before we get into that."

"Yes, it's going to be a pain the ass, but that's part of the point," said Mark Murray, executive director of Californians Against Waste.

"We do, however, have some carriers who bag more frequently (of their own initiative) in an effort to assure that the paper is in good condition.

There's not really a lot of accountability," Smith said.

"I am an Irish citizen living in S.F.

Today, I'll share some of these comments, but after this, please, no more feedback on bag fees.

"We've attempted to pursue this at a state level, but the lobbyists for the retail industry are too strong," he said.

Unwittingly, goats and sheep chewed  them, the officials said.

Dr. Aryamanya Mugisha, head of Uganda National Environment  Management Authority (NEMA), was quoted on Monday by local press  as saying that the measure would get rid of the increasing  environmental and health menace.

If a bag breaks when a customer is moving it from store to car or car to kitchen, most stores that are members of his association will replace the contents for free.

Some readers point out that city residents already pay for these costs through taxes and garbage-collection fees.

It's also the most environmentally damaging," said Kosta Kaporis, an engineer with the Bureau of Sanitation.

Trade groups representing grocers and the plastics industry predictably aren't crazy about the idea.

"Saving the environment can be done in many ways," writes Catherine Ying.

"We're not sure where it came from or ... where the 17 cents is going to go.

Grocers and the plastics industry oppose the measure.

In turn, the fee would be passed on to the consumer.

he writes.

They are limited in their re-use -- I don't have a dog and don't travel that often, as they make excellent wrappers for shoes or slippers," writes Doug Stewart.

And how about restaurants that put food "in those toxic Styrofoam boxes and then put the box in a bag."

Virtually all of them said it's a minor expense or inconvenience, but well worth it.

That accounts for about 2 percent of waste, at an annual cleanup cost of about $8.4 million (euro6.45 million).

After being considered by the commission, the proposal would move to the mayor's office or the Board of Supervisors in search of legislative sponsors.

The proposal, which takes the form of a resolution urging the mayor and board to take action, also suggests expanding the surcharge in the future beyond grocers to include drug stores, dry cleaners, newspapers and other retailers.

Los Angeles River ad hoc committee staffer Lupe Vela is in charge of task force preparation and hopes to bring industry representatives to the table first to see if they can develop voluntary programs.

"San Francisco has the wherewithal to charge that much.

Roughly one-third hate the idea, saying it's a government plot to raise taxes.

He adds that the department "would be open to any ideas that would address the issue."

"An excise duty of 50 percent was imposed on plastics in June 2002.

Some readers wonder why the proposal applies only to grocers.

"If I had my way, we would have started that immediately" she  told reporters.

The call came in a study of Kenya's solid waste management  presented to UNEP governors who are currently meeting at the  agency's headquarters here and was backed by Wangari Maathai, last  year's Nobel Peace Prize.

"This tax is going to hurt those who can least afford it."

Right now (it's) strictly supermarkets."

They use them to go to the dog park, empty the kitty litter, and a dozen other things.

"Shouldn't the amount that is presently being paid for garbage service be taken into consideration when determining how much it really costs the city?

-- Why just supermarkets?

The remaining third might warm to the idea, but have some questions and reservations.

That would eliminate the cost of creating a system to collect, track and distribute the fees.

So it sort of defeats the purpose," writes Jim Knowles of Alameda.

We might not have control over the blister packaging around the electronic equipment we buy.

Unlike paper or wood or other organic garbage, plastics don't biodegrade.

Authorities had better plans for the outlawed papers.

Reyes hopes the task force will hold its first meeting in March and produce recommendations 60 days later.

Mayor Gavin Newsom is reviewing the idea.

It might not matter soon.

Paul Smith, a vice president of the California Grocers Association, explains: "We try to minimize breakage to product."

"One thing we've learned is that sending a financial signal to the marketplace tends to modify behavior much better than voluntary approaches."

Wolde did not give the amount of the fine, but several sources  estimated that offenders can pay several thousands of nakfa.

Authorities here are indeed determined to stem the problem.

Loss of livestock can be depressing in this poor country that  regulary suffers from bouts of drought.

"We're willing to work toward that goal."

Or are residents supposed to pay twice for the same service?"

Rwanda and South Africa are moving towards a similar policy,  according to UNEP officials.

Customers can return home with their items confident that their purchases have been protected from dirt and germs.

It may be dirty, even if you can't see the dirt with your eyes.

And they were thrown  everywhere, got stuck in the trees, and spoiled the landscape," he  added.

Since a dollar here is worth 15 nakfa, such fines are hefty in  the country where, according to an International Monetary Fund  report, annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is 130  dollars (100 euros).

We do notify any of these carriers to stop bagging (except on rainy days) whenever we receive a call from a customer.

Kibrom expressed satisfaction on people's respect on the law,  nevertheless.

The key difference is that the retailers embraced this change as a way to tout their 'green' credentials by offering a free, sturdy shopping tote to each club member for a limited time to carry their groceries (enabling free advertising).

They stick to bottles and cans, and they clog sorting equipment.

"There are marketing reasons why we do this," he says.

With a threat of fine, Eritrean in the streets of Asmara have  no choice but to abide by this environmentally friendly law.

I remember the same excuses being trotted out when this was first introduced in Ireland (in 2002).

Trade groups contend that the results of those efforts are mixed.

Proponents of the surcharge hope this will persuade shoppers to give up the convenience of the disposable sack.

However, shop owners feel the government's decision was to hostile and too heavy for them.

They cause environmental damage by breaking into smaller pieces that are eaten by fish and wildlife.

It is also reported that cows died after eating this  material.
