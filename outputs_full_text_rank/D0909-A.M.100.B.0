The United States, he said, welcomed statements made this week  by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie  Ahern that the key to moving forward was for the Irish Republican  Army (IRA), Northern Ireland's main Catholic paramilitary group, to  end all violence unequivocally.

He said until the IRA did this, Protestant leaders would refuse to share power with Sinn Fein, the IRA-linked party that represents most Catholics.

The Irish and British governments hope for an answer before the  August holiday period from the IRA, which declared a ceasefire in  its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland ahead of a 1998  Good Friday peace deal which largely ended 30 years of violence.

Protestant factions in Northern Ireland are adamant that there  can be no political progress toward a lasting peace settlement  without a move by the IRA to end all criminal and paramilitary  activity.

The Irish and British governments hope for a response before the  August holiday period from the IRA, which declared a ceasefire in  its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland before a 1998  peace deal which largely ended 30 years of violence.

The comments from Northern Ireland Minister Peter Hain -- who  said the IRA statement could "open a new chapter" for the  British-ruled region --  came as it was announced that Prime  Minister Tony Blair and Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern would meet in  London this week.

Britain expects an "imminent" statement  from the IRA as to whether the Northern Irish paramilitary group is  to agree to an appeal from its political wing to abandon violence, a  government minister said Monday.

Northern Ireland's Good Friday peace accord of 1998 proposed the creation of a joint Catholic-Protestant administration involving Sinn Fein, the IRA-linked party that represents most of the province's Catholics.

The London summit was taking place as all sides in Northern  Ireland wait to see if the Protestant marching season passes  peacefully and if the Irish Republican Army (IRA) will respond  positively to an appeal from Gerry Adams, leader of its Sinn Fein  political wing, to disarm and fully embrace democracy.

Northern Ireland's 7-year-old peace accord will eventually work but requires the Irish Republican Army to deliver a "clear and decisive" end to all its activities, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Friday.

The IRA declared a ceasefire in its campaign to end British rule  in Northern Ireland before the 1998 peace deal, which largely ended  30 years of sectarian violence in the province.

Northern Ireland's peace process would  receive a major boost if the Irish Republican Army responds  positively to appeals to embrace political methods, a leading figure  in the paramilitary group's political wing said Friday.

Ahern said he explained to Adams the clear position required by  the Irish government before negotiations could resume on restoring  the power-sharing political institutions in British-ruled Northern  Ireland.

They said the Irish Republican Army was standing in the way of revived Catholic-Protestant cooperation in Northern Ireland.

Answering questions in parliament, Ahern told MPs that the  meetings with Adams, whose party is the political wing of the IRA,  Northern Ireland's main Catholic paramilitary group, had merely been  to maintain dialogue.

In April, Adams appealed to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to  end violence and fully embrace democratic means.

Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain said the government was soon expecting the IRA to issue a new peace declaration that would address a long-standing demand for the outlawed group to disarm fully and disband.

British and Irish efforts to revive power-sharing and secure a  permanent settlement collapsed before Christmas after Sinn Fein  rejected Protestant demands for photographic proof of IRA weapons  destruction.

The pair would meet at the House of Commons on Wednesday,  officials in Dublin said, with Ahern also holding talks with Ian  Paisley, leader of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant political  group, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).

Ian Paisley, the top Protestant politician in Northern Ireland, called Wednesday for the outlawed IRA to disarm and disband.

The major Protestant party, the Democratic Unionists, refuses to cooperate with Sinn Fein, the IRA-linked party that represents most Catholics, citing the IRA's continued underground activities.

Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will, by the  end of this month, announce a plan for a complete and swift process  of disarmament.

"We now need the IRA to deliver a clear and decisive response to Gerry Adams' recent appeal," Ahern said.

Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will, by the  end of June, announce a plan for a complete and swift process of  disarmament.

Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern  admitted on Tuesday that he had held a series of private one-on-one  meetings on the Northern Ireland peace process with Sinn Fein leader  Gerry Adams, but denied they had been secret in any way.

The 1998 Good Friday peace deal paved the way for a  Protestant-Catholic power-sharing assembly, but that was suspended  more than two years ago amid allegations of IRA espionage.

The search for unmarked graves of IRA victims is one of many unfinished chapters of Northern Ireland's peace process.

Police and O'Connor's family say IRA members killed him, probably because he had been arguing with an IRA member over a money-raising racket the IRA was running in South Armagh, a major power base for the outlawed group.

In a speech to British and Irish academics at University College Dublin, Ahern said the U.S.-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998 contained a complex set of goals that, if achieved, would ensure a stable, peaceful Northern Ireland.

Blair and Ahern underlined their desire for the quick return of  a self-governing Northern Ireland and urged the IRA to cooperate.

London and Dublin are awaiting for an Irish Republican Army  response to a call from Gerry Adams, leader of the group's Sinn Fein  political wing, for an end to violence.

Last month, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, a reputed IRA commander, appealed to IRA members to leave behind their "armed struggle" in favor of democratic politics.

The IRA in 1999 described the locations of eight burial spots to a joint British-Irish commission coordinating the search, but remains of only three IRA victims have been found.

But in a nod to Protestant leaders' unwillingness to form a power-sharing government immediately with Sinn Fein, Hain said an unspecified delay would be reasonable to determine whether the IRA was telling the truth.

Northern Ireland has seen a virtual end to more than 30 years of  violence since the landmark 1998 Good Friday peace deal, but Dublin  and London, as well as an independent monitoring body, have accused  paramilitary groups of continued criminal activities.

In April, Since Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams made a direct  appeal to IRA "volunteers" to give up all violence and adopt  democratic methods, since then the Catholic paramilitary group has  been holding meetings to discuss a response.

Any public pledge by the Irish Republican Army to cease all activities, including crime, should be weighed over time to test whether it's genuine, the British governor of Northern Ireland said Tuesday.

The 1998 peace deal paved the way for a Protestant-Catholic  power-sharing assembly, but that was suspended more than two years  ago amid allegations of IRA espionage.

"Words are not enough, but they are an important start, and I hope people would not underestimate the significance of a credible statement from the IRA," he said.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair and  Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern were to chair the first major review  of the Northern Ireland situation since the British general election  in May at a meeting in London later Monday.

The 1998 Good Friday peace deal largely ended three decades of  intercommunity violence in Northern Ireland and established a  power-sharing executive and assembly.

"I fully support Gerry Adams' appeal and I sincerely hope that  the IRA does respond to it positively," McGuinness said.

He will also be holding talks with Ian Paisley, leader of  Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant political group, the  Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).

He said it would also put "enormous pressure" on Northern  Ireland's largest party, the hardline Democratic Unionist Party led  by Ian Paisley, "to come on board the peace process" for the first  time.

In April, Adams called on the IRA to "fully embrace and accept"  democratic means and end all paramilitary activities.

"There is no alternative to sharing power with Irish  republicans; there is no alterative to the all-Ireland architecture  and the equality agenda of the Good Friday Agreement," McGuinness  said.

These included a total end to IRA paramilitarism and related  criminality and full decommissioning of the IRA's arms and  explosives arsenals.

The newspaper said Adams, chief negotiator Martin McGuinness and  convicted gun-runner Martin Ferris who is an lawmaker in the Irish  Republic's parliament have all resigned from the seven-man army  council of the Catholic IRA paramilitary group.

But he said the pact's key goal _ a joint Catholic-Protestant administration _ would be revived only "in the context of a complete end to IRA paramilitarism and criminality and the putting beyond use of their weapons."

"I am confident, now, with an imminent IRA statement expected,  which I hope will be credible, that it will open a new chapter in  Northern Irish politics," Hain told BBC Radio Ulster.

Ahern said he was hopeful that the IRA would issue a declaration within the next few months spelling out whether it will disarm and cease all threatening activities.

The IRA has denied involvement.

Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, which represents most of the territory's British Protestant majority, says it won't cooperate with Sinn Fein unless the IRA backs up words with meaningful public action _ particularly the publication of photos of its disarmament.

"It is clear that a positive response from the IRA would have an  immediate and enormous impact on the political situation."

Ahern and Paisley _ a hard-liner who opposes Irish involvement in Northern Ireland and didn't begin meeting Ahern until last year _ spoke separately after a 90-minute meeting at the Irish embassy in London.

Ahern was also meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has worked closely with Ahern since 1997 to broker compromise in Northern Ireland, which is a part of the United Kingdom.

McGuinness claimed a positive response would deal with the  "genuine concerns" of Protestant unionists, who want Northern  Ireland to remain part of Britain, and remove any excuse for  unionist party leaders refusing to negotiate directly with Sinn  Fein.

British and Irish efforts to revive power-sharing and secure a  permanent settlement collapsed before Christmas after Sinn Fein  rejected Protestant demands for photographic proof of weapons  destruction.

Earlier this year, Adams has made a direct appeal to IRA  "volunteers" to embrace purely political and democratic activity.

Paisley emphasized Wednesday he would wait for at least six months following an IRA peace declaration to see whether the group followed through with deeds.

A deal on the so-called "decommissioning" of IRA weapons was  almost reached at the end of last year, but foundered on demands  from the DUP that the process by verified through photographs.

A deal on the so-called "decommissioning" of IRA weapons was  almost reached at the end of last year, but foundered on demands  from the DUP that the process by verified through photographs.

The agreement paved the way for a Protestant-Catholic  power-sharing assembly that was suspended more than two years ago  amid a crisis of confidence and allegations of IRA espionage.

BIIGC meetings are normally only attended by the Irish foreign  minister and the British secretary of state for Northern Ireland but  there is provision to scale them up to "summit level" involving both  prime ministers.

Three senior Sinn Fein leaders,  including party president Gerry Adams, have stepped down from their  posts on the ruling body of the party's Irish Republican Army  military wing according to the Irish Independent newspaper on  Saturday.

"Everybody has their tongue out waiting for a statement from the IRA.

The discussions were to cover political developments in Northern  Ireland, security and criminal justice matters, policing, the  marching season involving the Protestant loyalist Orange Order,  human rights and equality, cross-border matters in Ireland and  Anglo-Irish questions.

The IRA was supposed to have scrapped all of its stockpiled weapons by mid-2000 in support of the Good Friday deal.

"To move forward, we need a clear, unambiguous end of all paramilitary and criminal activity and we need to see the completion of (weapons) decommissioning," Ahern said.

It says their posts have been filled by three men from Northern  Ireland who are closely aligned to the Adams-McGuinness group  pushing the movement onto a purely political path.

Power-sharing collapsed in 2002 following chronic arguments over IRA activities and weaponry.

At the time of his disappearance, O'Connor had been driving towards a police station to report for bail in the neighboring Republic of Ireland, where he was facing trial for membership in a splinter group called the Real IRA.

"It would give much needed new momentum to the peace process,"  Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness told a summer school in  the Irish Republic.

In an unusual show of agreement, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and the Rev.

"The United States continues to support fully the British and  Irish governments' efforts to implement the Good Friday Accords,"  State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.

The group has rejected responsibility for several other long-missing people abducted from IRA power bases in the 1970s.

"It is only on that basis that we can move forward," Ahern  said.

Ahern stressed to MPs that Northern Ireland was entering the  summer season of Protestant loyalist Orange Order marches, that  traditionally cause tensions between Catholics and Protestants.

The IRA's alleged misdeeds were highlighted by a massive bank  raid in Belfast in December, blamed by police on the group, as well  as the murder of Robert McCartney, a Belfast man beaten and stabbed  to death in a bar in what his relatives say was an attack carried  out by IRA activists.

In an unprecedented charge in January, Irish Justice Minister  Michael McDowell claimed the three Sinn Fein men were leaders of  both the political and military wings of the republican movement.

US Secretary of State Condoleezza  Rice met Wednesday with British Secretary of State for Northern  Ireland Peter Hain and reaffirmed support for the implementation of  the Good Friday accords.

The talks, which will include senior ministers from both sides,  were being held under the auspices of the British-Irish  Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) which was set up under the 1998  Good Friday peace agreement.

"For that trust to be restored there must be a clear, definitive and permanent end to paramilitary activity and its associated criminality," Hain said in a speech to the annual conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.

Dooley said the O'Connor family's "worst has come to the worst," but the relatives of others slain by the IRA had not been allowed to lay their loved ones to rest.

However, in a joint statement the trio "categorically" denied  they were members of the ruling body of the outlawed IRA and accused  McDowell of abusing his office.

The IRA killed about 1,800 people from 1970 to 1997, when it called an open-ended truce.

Both emphasized that the IRA must demonstrate its voluntary demise in concrete ways.

Sean Dooley made his plea at the funeral of Gareth O'Connor, 24, an IRA dissident who disappeared in May 2003.

"I think it is going to be very difficult to persuade unionism  of the sincerity of any republican move, which is why that move has  got to be clear and bold," he said.

"The holding of a meeting of the BIIGC at summit level is a  demonstration of the close working and high level partnership  between the two governments," the Irish government statement said.

The IRA rejected those terms in December and since has been implicated in a string of criminal scandals, including a world-record bank robbery, the knife slaying of a Catholic man and a money-laundering network.

Despite this, IRA members continue to administer crippling beatings _ and occasionally fatal shootings and stabbings _ to their criminal opponents in Catholic areas.

He said there had been "possibly three or four meetings" with  Adams since March.

Ahern is to meet his British counterpart Tony Blair in London on  Wednesday.

"The changes in personnel are also seen as part of the  "sanitisation" process within Sinn Fein as the party prepares to  present itself as a democratic body that is ready to play a full  part in political developments north and south of the border," the  Independent says.

They warned that such a government would only be achieved  provided that peace prevailed in the British-ruled province.

... We are looking for action," Paisley said.

We haven't got our tongues out.

"On balance, these meetings at this particular time were better  conducted outside the glare of publicity," Ahern said.

A Roman Catholic priest appealed Saturday to the Irish Republican Army to reveal the burial spots of more than a dozen people whose bodies have never been found.

In a direct plea to those who killed more than a dozen IRA victims, mostly in the 1970s and early 1980s, he asked, "How can you go home to your families every night knowing the hell these families are enduring?"

"A commitment in words needs to be capable of being verified over a period of time so that everyone can see that the commitment is real and lasting," he said.

The newspaper says none of the new appointees is a member of  Sinn Fein but all are regarded within the Provisional republican  movement as militarists with proven records.

The Independent says that in the wake of the London bombings,  and with an increasingly hostile climate towards terrorist violence,  the Provisional movement is understood to have decided that this is  the right time to move into a new mode.

"It is also a demonstration of the commitment of the two  governments to pursue progress across the range of issues embraced  by the Good Friday agreement."

If we get a statement on the issues I have mentioned, we would be very happy with the statement.

The Rev.

If it  is done and it is done genuinely and violence is genuinely given up,  then the obligation then transfers to unionists to make sure that  they drop their opposition to going into a power-sharing  executive."

But we would, naturally enough, want to see that they happen."

"The ground-breaking decision means that all links between the  leadership of the political and military wings of the Provisional  movement have been severed.

Speaking to reporters earlier Monday, Blair repeated his call  for republicans to unequivocally give up violence and commit  themselves to wholly democratic methods.

"I hope that this response will be translated into clear reality on the ground."

"It's immensely important that they do make this move...

"I appeal to anybody who has any information about the disappeared to contact their families directly or indirectly so that other bodies may be cut down from the crosses and given Christian burials," Dooley told several hundred mourners at O'Connor's funeral Mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral in Newry.

Last weekend, police divers found his body still inside his car in a canal in Newry, 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of Belfast.

But he stressed, "It is not just words, it is deeds.

Instead it began a secrecy-shrouded process in October 2001 and halted it in October 2003 still in possession of much of its arsenal.
