George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg were able Wednesday to name 31 members of the board of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation.

The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation's board also includes former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Disney CEO Michael Eisner and several trade center victims' family members.

Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which is overseeing the memorial, described the new elements as "simple acts, knitted together to create a powerful memorial at the heart of the World Trade Center site."

Bush and Bill Clinton had all pledged their support for the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and would serve as honorary members of the board of directors.

That is a lot of responsibility, with many implications for the way the public will experience the memorial, the interpretive memorial center and the museums and the theaters, since the foundation is also charged with "encouraging the development of cultural facilities as part of the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site."

The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation board met Wednesday for the first time before emerging for an introduction to the site by the architects Daniel Libeskind and Michael Arad.

Robert De Niro, Barbara Walters, David Rockefeller and other members of the foundation charged with raising money for a World Trade Center memorial held their first meeting.

And Pataki announced that the underground memorial interpretive center, where artifacts and exhibits will tell the story of the trade center and the 2001 and 1993 attacks, will be designed by the Manhattan firm Davis Brody Bond, which is already associated with Michael Arad and Peter Walker on the memorial itself; the Norwegian firm Snohetta, which is working on the museum complex at the trade center site; and Howard-Revis Design of Washington, which specializes in designing exhibits.

The memorial board also included retired New York firefighter Lee Ielpi and Monica Iken, whose husband was killed in the trade center attack.

"That is why it is so important that when the new World Trade Center has been completed, we have a memorial that captures the depth of those attacks and preserves their full impact for future generations," he said.

One of the working members will be Brian Mulroney, a former prime minister of Canada, whose presence symbolizes the international importance of the memorial, said Kevin M. Rampe, president of the development corporation and a foundation board member.

A fragment of granite bearing the name "John" _ all that remains of a memorial to the six people killed in the first terror attack on the World Trade Center _ was installed Saturday as the central piece of a new memorial.

A total of 31 people were named to the board of directors of the memorial foundation, a non-profit corporation that will construct, own, operate and maintain the memorial.

The 33-member board set up governance and executive committees before meeting Wednesday with trade center master planner Daniel Libeskind and memorial architect Michael Arad near the building site.

George Pataki said the world has "a sacred duty to remember" and Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the new memorial "will speak to generations of New Yorkers of our duty to remain relentlessly vigilant."

Bush and Bill Clinton would serve as honorary members of the memorial foundation, which will raise money for the memorial and the cultural centers.

The mission of the nonprofit foundation is to oversee and coordinate fund-raising and construction of the memorial and the cultural buildings at the trade center site.

Having been eclipsed for most of this year by other issues at ground zero, the World Trade Center memorial returned to the forefront Monday as Gov.

All four living former US presidents have agreed to become honorary directors of the project for a permanent memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center.

"At the heart of the rebuilding is the creation of a lasting memorial which will honor the memories of those we lost and help tell their story to the world," said New York Governor George Pataki.

But the foundation was given a broader range of powers in its April 2003 certificate of incorporation, beginning with its purpose: "To own, construct, operate and maintain a memorial and related structures and appurtenances on the site of the World Trade Center."

However, it would also mean that Greenwich Street would rise almost 5 feet higher than the memorial plaza.

The task of raising half a billion dollars to build a World Trade Center memorial, a museum building and a performing arts center will fall to a foundation made up of captains of finance and real estate, cultural leaders, media heavyweights and seven relatives of those killed on 9/11.

The World Trade Center memorial will preserve not only the memory of those who died on Sept. 11, 2001, but the remnants -- visible and even tangible -- of the buildings that died that morning, too.

Heading the list of boldface names, in one arena or another, are Robert DeNiro, who has been a presence in the nearby TriBeCa area for many years; Barbara Walters of ABC; David Rockefeller, who was deeply involved in the original development of the World Trade Center; and Michael D. Eisner, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Co.

"The construction of Greenwich Street through the World Trade Center site is another of the complex engineering issues that must be carefully studied and resolved as we move forward with the redevelopment," said Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., the executive director of the Port Authority.

"The memorial will be the centerpiece and our first priority in the rebuilding effort," Pataki said at a luncheon event in New York City.

John C. Whitehead, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., will head the foundation until the board members have a chance to meet next month and select a chairman.

The architectural team designing the World Trade Center (WTC) memorial presented an update on its plans Thursday afternoon.

Four US ex-presidents, a Hollywood legend, a retired fireman and a star TV journalist were among those appointed Wednesday to lead the project for a memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center.

The governor said that financing of the memorial should be the "first and most important" priority for the $816 million in federal grants that have yet to be allocated by the Lower Manhattan Development Corp.

Lower Manhattan Development Corp. Chairman John Whitehead last month called Memorial Hall a public space where visitors will be able to "review a directory of the names, locating their loved ones among the souls that are there."

Also next month, he said, deconstruction will begin on the damaged, shrouded 40-story Deutsche Bank building across Liberty Street from the trade center site.

Chairman and chief executive of the Bank of New York Co.

That would permit a level approach to the memorial at Dey Street.

The base of the trade center site is at elevation 243 feet.

George Pataki urged passage of an income tax checkoff that would allow New York taxpayers to donate to the memorial.

If Greenwich Street must rise that high, the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. has concluded that a wall will be needed along much of the adjacent part of the memorial.

They have been given the task of raising $500 million (euro378 million) to build both a memorial to the victims of the 2001 and 1993 trade center attacks and adjoining cultural facilities.

Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the development corporation and a foundation director, said, "The board clearly understands the public trust which they have undertaken and are committed to the same level of transparency as the LMDC."

"There is no law that requires that the board must be open," said Ira M. Millstein, a senior partner in the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, who is counsel to the development corporation board and one of the foundation's directors.

Next month, Pataki said, construction is to begin on the new South Ferry subway station and on two stations that are part of the planned Fulton Street Transit Center on Broadway.

The first big pledge may be said to have come last week, when Pataki declared in a speech that the highest priority for the remaining $816 million in unallocated federal grants controlled by the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. should be "to guarantee that we have the funds necessary to build the memorial."

On this scale, the high point on Greenwich Street is at elevation 316 feet, the memorial plaza at 311.2 feet.

Arad said his memorial will try "to make present what is absent" since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack that brought down the twin towers and other buildings.

On Thursday, almost a year after the world saw the earliest renderings of the plan called "Reflecting Absence," three architects guided their listeners -- the governor of New York and the mayor of New York City among them -- on a trip through the schematic design, showing in more detail the spaces that will compose the memorial when it opens in 2009.

Speyer, the chairman and chief executive of Tishman Speyer Properties, whose portfolio includes Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building, agreed to serve on the board that he would not lead.

New York Governor George Pataki said Monday that Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W.

Between this wall and the museum complex at Fulton Street and a stairway at Liberty Street, there would be only two small areas where one could walk straight into the memorial from Greenwich Street, the approach most visitors will probably take.

"The primary responsibility that we have is to those who lost so much on that terrible day," said memorial designer Michael Arad.

The memorial will include a forest of oak trees with a clearing for Sept. 11 gatherings and a Memorial Hall between the reflecting pools that will mark the footprints of the lost towers.

John C. Whitehead, the interim chairman, told board members that meeting minutes would be made public.

The World Trade Center Downtown Restoration Program datum is closely related to that of the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad, now PATH, which was integral to the development of the twin towers in the 1960s.

"We can never forget the tragic events of September 11," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement.

The lowest point in the PATH system is midway in Tunnel E, the outbound route from the trade center to New Jersey, at elevation 212 feet.

He said the memorial will help tell the story of Sept. 11 and the lost lives, so that future generations will understand the enormity of what happened here.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site and will build the streets, said that height would permit the installation of as many utility lines as are needed within the roadbed, directly above the subway tunnel for the Nos.

"My father and these other five people were the first World Trade Center victims, and it's our duty to make sure they're not forgotten."

Governor George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined the team of architects to present a more detailed description of what visitors will experience at the memorial and the surrounding plaza.

"As the mayor of New York and also as a citizen of New York," he said, "I plan to do my part to ensure these projects reach their full potential."

The trade center datum is 2.653 feet above the old railroad datum.

Last month, for instance, members of the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York showed up to criticize the corporation for not helping finance a restaurant planned downtown to employ displaced workers from Windows on the World.

As engaging as last season's architectural beauty contests may have been, the real form of the future World Trade Center is being decided now.

Don't look now -- actually, you can't look now -- but a great deal of decision-making about the public realm at the new World Trade Center may disappear from public view behind closed boardroom doors.

After his speech, Pataki visited the 21st floor of the Deutsche Bank building and then the muddy pit of ground zero, where outlines of the column remnants of 1 World Trade Center have been exposed.

Beginning on a plaza forested with some 300 oak trees and a one-and-a-half-acre open area that can double as a civic gathering place for as many as 10,000 people, visitors will make their way down two switchback ramps, each as long as a city block, that will take them 30 feet below ground into the central memorial hall.

"We have to have a memorial that really allows us to connect the sheer enormity of the Twin Towers, to the individuals that were taken from us," said Bloomberg.

The memorial is scheduled to open in 2009.

The memorial is scheduled to open in 2009.

In describing the memorial -- "Picture the old foundations of the Louvre in France or the catacombs at the Vatican" -- Pataki said the column remnants of the twin towers would be kept visible, "laying bare the very roots of the towers as visitors absorb the meaning of what took place here."

But it could profoundly affect a visitor's experience by creating the need for a wall running more than 200 feet along the Greenwich Street side of the memorial, marking an abrupt grade change between plaza level and sidewalk.

Because the board includes Robert De Niro and Barbara Walters, there were many cameras and microphones to capture that moment in the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, overlooking ground zero.

The pools are to sit almost empty, with water running down the sides only, symbolizing the vacuum left by the 2,749 people who died when two hijacked planes were crashed into the trade center's twin towers.

"We have to remember that 9/11 began in 1993," said Michael Macko of New York City, son of victim William Macko.

George E. Pataki said Thursday.

"This is a decision for the board to make," Millstein said.

To the public, the tough part of designing the memorial may seem to have passed last year with the choice of a concept, the twin voids of "Reflecting Absence," and the selection of architects: Michael Arad, Peter Walker & Partners and Davis Brody Bond.

Pataki praised designers for creating a fitting memorial to those who lost their lives at the WTC site.

The roster seems to reflect some geopolitical ticket-splitting, with the chairmen of giant downtown companies like American Express, American International Group and the Bank of New York balanced by Robert Wood Johnson IV, the owner of the New York Jets, who hopes to build a new football stadium on the far West Side.

Pataki had already said that four former presidents -- Bill Clinton, George H.W.

President of the Carnegie Corp. of New York.

In a ceremony above the gaping pit remaining from the Sept. 11, 2001, attack that destroyed the complex and the original memorial, an honor guard of Port Authority officers placed the fragment in a 9 1/2-foot-tall (2.9-meter-high) steel pylon shaped like one of the twin towers.

"Reflecting Absence" by architect Michael Arad, which features two reflecting pools surrounded by gardens, was chosen from 5,201 entries submitted to an international memorial design competition.

The working members of the board are to be named next week by the governor and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.

Here, the surface would be 2 feet higher than at Fulton Street to the north and 6 feet higher than at Liberty Street to the south.

"It's absolutely critical that we take the steps necessary to set the grade in a way that achieves the objective we all share of knitting the site back into the community, both physically and visually," Kevin M. Rampe, president of the development corporation, said Wednesday.

In January, 2004, a 13-member jury selected "Reflecting Absence " by Michael Arad and Peter Walker as the design for the WTC memorial.

The Lower Manhattan Development Corp. maintains a virtual library of important planning documents on its Web site, www.renewnyc.com, and opens its monthly board meetings to the public and the press.

Severed during the clearing of ground zero, many steel and concrete column footings that still outline the perimeters of the twin towers will be made part of the memorial itself, as will a 70-foot-tall, 250-foot-long section of the original slurry wall.

George E. Pataki offered a preview of the completed design, which he said will be ready next month.

"You probably won't find a board of any higher caliber anywhere in the city," said Bloomberg, who knows a thing or two about philanthropy.

The truth is that the two-hour meeting was closed to the public and the news media, since the foundation is a private corporation.

Over the past months, the design team, with associate architect Max Bond, embarked on the schematic design process to develop the physical and programmatic elements of the memorial.

Until Wednesday afternoon, even the designated members did not know whom all their colleagues would be.

On this level, the north tower's foundations will be exposed in a chamber more than 60 feet high.

"I wanted to be helpful but, frankly, it was a matter of time," he said Wednesday.

Not only would that wall block physical access but it would also diminish the designers' goal of direct sight lines into the plaza from the surrounding sidewalks.

Though they are tightly organized, with little freewheeling discussion, it is possible to see fissures within the board by paying attention to the questions, objections and exceptions that members register, even as they vote -- generally unanimously -- to adopt the items before them.

Conceivably, then, the foundation may start its $500 million campaign with several hundred million dollars already available.
