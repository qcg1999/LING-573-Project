Some lawyers, including those who had filed suits against Merck before the Vioxx withdrawal, said that they already had plenty of evidence of the drug's dangers before last week's announcement.

Even before Merck pulled Vioxx from the market on Sept. 30, citing what it said was new evidence that the drug increased the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other serious ailments, hundreds of patients had filed lawsuits around the country.

Net income plunged 29 percent for pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. in the third quarter due to costs for withdrawing its arthritis drug Vioxx from the market, and the company on Thursday said hundreds of lawsuits have been filed related to the drug.

Hundreds and perhaps thousands of new Vioxx lawsuits are likely to be filed, lawyers said, with many of them class actions that aim to represent large groups of Vioxx users who have taken the drug for extended periods.

Merck said Monday that it was still looking into how many Vioxx users fell into that group.

In the hundreds of Vioxx lawsuits filed before Merck took the drug off the market, the action was primarily in New Jersey, where Merck is based, and the big states of Texas and California.

Merck announced a global withdrawal Thursday of Vioxx, a blockbuster arthritis drug, after a study showed it increased the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

They also charge that Merck's aggressive marketing of Vioxx failed to disclose adequately the information the company had about those risks and that Merck did not diligently pursue research into the hazards of Vioxx.

The European Medicines Agency is to review all drugs in the same class as Vioxx after US pharmaceutical giant Merck withdrew the arthritis drug, a spokesman for the agency said Friday.

The pharmaceutical firm Merck faces a new class-action lawsuit in Canada, filed on behalf of two people who suffered heart attacks after taking the company's pain medication Vioxx, which was taken off the market worldwide because of such risks, plaintiffs' lawyers said Friday.

Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against Merck over Vioxx and one analyst believes it could cost the company up to $12 billion.

Shares of Merck & Co. plunged more than 10 percent Monday after a media report said that documents show the pharmaceutical giant hid or denied evidence for years that its blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx cause heart problems.

Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said the risk of an individual patient having a heart attack or stroke related to Vioxx is small, the agency also said "there appear to be significant safety concerns."

In addition, many possible Vioxx victims may find it difficult to pin their health problems on the drug if forced to go to trial, lawyers who filed the early cases said.

"Both sides will try to spin this in their favor," said Vincent S. Walkowiak, a Dallas lawyer who has worked for Merck in other cases but is not involved in the Vioxx litigation.

"The person who should never have taken Vioxx and should have been warned by Merck, the person with multiple risks of cardiac problems, may not make the best client, because it may be harder to prove that Vioxx caused the heart attack," said Cynthia Anne Solomon, a lawyer in Mt.

A study sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration estimates that Merck painkiller Vioxx, withdrawn from the market in September, could have caused 27,785 heart attacks or deaths since it was approved in 1999.

Merck & Co. removed Vioxx from use Thursday after new study results showed increased risk of heart attacks and stroke in people who used it for longer than 18 months.

Although that study's findings did not cause Vioxx to be withdrawn, Miller and Lopez-Mendez said the results put Vioxx lower on their list for prescribing.

Merck had argued that a comparison between Vioxx and a generic anti-inflammatory drug called naproxen was misleading because the latter could help protect against heart attacks or strokes.

Merck pulled the 2.5 billion dollar-a-year-seller Vioxx off the market on September 30 when an internal study found it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke after 18 months of continuous use.

Merck's withdrawal of Vioxx has made it much easier for lawyers to argue to a jury that the product should not have been on the market.

Last week's decision by Merck to halt sales of Vioxx, its blockbuster painkiller, could lead to an onslaught of new lawsuits against the company.

Hundreds of plaintiffs' lawyers who claim that people were injured or killed by the painkiller Vioxx plan to meet next week to lay groundwork for a nationwide legal assault against the drug's maker, Merck.

The crucial role Vioxx plays in Merck's portfolio was apparent last week when Merck's shares plunged 27 percent to $33 after the withdrawal announcement.

Anderson wrote that he believes there is value in the company's drug pipeline but said it is likely to get lost in the negative Vioxx coverage.

Merck, which has said it pulled the drug as soon as it had conclusive evidence of unacceptable risk, declined to discuss its defense strategy.

Last month, Merck had said the Vioxx recall would slash 50 cents to 60 cents off its earnings per share for the year; on Thursday, it said the impact would be 50 cents to 55 cents.

The additional, more serious step taken Monday reflects the momentum in the Vioxx litigation and the delay in launching Arcoxia, Vioxx's successor drugs, said S&P analyst Arthur Wong.

Last week, a consumer group in Quebec filed suit against Merck, charging that it kept Vioxx on the market despite the risks.

Merck announced that it would withdraw Vioxx from the market after it learned on Sept. 23 that the drug's users were twice as likely to suffer heart attacks or strokes as test subjects receiving a placebo.

Another study -- this one released in August on a review of more than 1 million HMO patients -- found a three-fold risk of cardiovascular incidents in patients taking 25 mg or more Vioxx, Lopez-Mendez said.

The US Food and Drug Administration also has said it would study the effects of other drugs in the same class as the withdrawn drug.

Merck has said it does not know yet how large that group is.

Based on the number of Vioxx customers and the seriousness of the injuries, the Vioxx lawsuits would appear to have the potential to dwarf recent cases like the one against Baycol, a cholesterol-lowering drug used by about 700,000 Americans, and the one against the diet supplement fen-phen, which an estimated 6 million people took.

It said that it "acted responsibly and appropriately as it developed and marketed Vioxx."

The risk was only slightly greater than average with less than 25 milligrams, she said, adding that the American College of Rheumatology sent members the results of that presentation days before Merck withdrew Vioxx.

The study, published Tuesday, also suggested Merck tried to explain away signs that showed Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks, in company-sponsored clinical trials four years ago.

On Thursday, the Lancet, a respected British medical journal, published an analysis of all the clinical trials of Vioxx completed by 2001, and concluded that Merck and the FDA should have known enough about the drug's hazards to withdraw it years ago.

The decision to recall Vioxx could have an impact on whether the drug is found to be defective, according to Walkowski.

Merck, one of the world's top five drug makers, said Thursday it earned $1.33 billion (euro1.06 billion), or 60 cents (48 euro cents) per share.

"The plaintiffs will say this is confirmation of Vioxx's dangers and Merck will use it to establish that it is behaving responsibly."

The personal injury lawsuits -- or tort cases, as lawyers call them -- can be filed in state or federal courts and in many cases name other parties, like doctors or drug distributor, as co-defendants with Merck.

When Merck withdrew Vioxx, S&P lowered its outlook to negative from stable.

Vioxx has been taken by about 20 million Americans and had produced 11 percent of Merck's total revenues.

He and others said that Merck, if it follows the course of other drug companies in similar situations, is likely to try to settle the strongest cases against it and fight some of the weaker claims in trials.

That means Vioxx results cannot automatically be extended to Celebrex and Bextra, which are in the Cox-2 classification with Vioxx but are not identical to it.

Lewis and her partners took on nearly 300 such cases by the time Merck pulled the plug on Vioxx.

"The data for Celebrex is robust and exceeds, in the length of patients in studies and in the size of studies, the data Vioxx has," she said.

But articles released Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine say Vioxx may not be the only drug of its type that raises the heart and stroke risk.

But the financial burden of taking on a giant like Merck while it continued to insist that Vioxx was safe and effective scared away many lawyers.

The pharmaceutical group decided on September 30 to pull its anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx off the shelves after three years of clinical studies showed that there was an increased risk of stroke or heart attack after 18 months of treatment.

But while patients need to stop taking Vioxx, local physicians said, it is not always easy to decide on a new course of treatment.

Some plaintiffs could ask Merck to finance more research into the effects of the drug.

Vioxx's $2.5 billion in sales accounted for about 11 percent of Merck's revenue last year and, according to analysts' estimates, about $1.2 billion, or 18 percent, of its earnings.

Dr. Ada Lopez-Mendez, a rheumatology specialist at Winter Haven Hospital, said patients should return the Vioxx they have.

Merck, one of the world's top five drug makers, pulled the arthritis and acute pain drug from the market worldwide on Sept. 30, saying it was acting in patients' best interest.

The injuries linked to Vioxx are also common among people who have not used the drug, and they have many causes.

Some states have statutes that create a presumption that there is no defect in drugs and drug labels that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration; Vioxx had such approval.

Pfizer's medical director, Gail Cawkwell, said in a statement that "the data for Celebrex is robust and exceeds, in the length of patients in studies and in the size of studies, the data Vioxx has."

It said unsold Vioxx inventory, estimated customer returns and costs to pull the blockbuster drug from the market worldwide totaled $552.6 million (euro438.4 million) in the third quarter.

The trial whose results pulled Vioxx off the market was designed to check how well 25 mg of Vioxx did in preventing recurrence of polyps in the colon.

Some of those lawyers said they were worried that lawyers who rushed into the field after Merck withdrew the drug, including law firms soliciting clients with radio and print advertising, will muddy the legal landscape with questionable claims.

Results of clinical studies with one drug in a given class do not necessarily apply to other drugs in the same class, the FDA said.

In a separate report released by the New England Journal, Dr. Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic chastises the FDA for not requiring Merck to do studies investigating heart problems with Vioxx when hints of them first appeared years ago.

Many lawyers involved in the lawsuits say the federal consolidation process should hasten final settlement of most of the Vioxx cases.

That is one reason doctors and patients welcomed the new NSAIDs known as Cox-2 inhibitors -- Vioxx, Celebrex and Bextra -- as they started entering the market in the 1990s.

The most serious health risks associated with Vioxx seem to appear after consumers have been taking the drug for 18 months or longer.

Several lawsuits have been filed since Thursday, including a class action against Merck Frosst, the Canadian subsidiary of Merck, brought by a consumers' group in Quebec.

The data came to light in a major clinical trial that Merck had hoped would show that Vioxx could help prevent colon polyps, which can become cancerous.

Merck had contested all previous reports that Vioxx was dangerous, contending they were based on faulty or inconclusive research.

With Vioxx coming off the pharmacy shelves, what is a patient who took that drug for pain supposed to do?

Merck shares were down $3.19, or 10.2 percent, at $28.12 on the New York Stock Exchange after The Wall Street Journal reported that internal e-mails and marketing materials show the company knew as far back as 2000 that Vioxx was linked to an increased risk of heart attack but tried to discredit such evidence.

Because of lost revenues for Vioxx, which had about $2.5 billion in 2003 sales, or 11 percent of total company revenues, Merck said Thursday that fourth-quarter earnings per share will only be 48 cents (38 euro cents) to 53 cents (42 euro cents), with full-year earnings per share at $2.59 to $2.64 (euro2.05 to euro2.09).

He said the drugs remain a "rational choice" for patients at low risk of cardiovascular problems who have had serious gastrointestinal events (such as bleeding), but he said it would "seem prudent" to avoid them with patients who have or are at risk of cardiovascular disease.

But the effort to centralize the federal cases while sorting out which cases will remain in state courts -- where plaintiffs' lawyers usually prefer them -- could very likely lead to procedure battles that may delay the first Vioxx trials.

As a result, the pioneering plaintiffs' lawyers in the Vioxx litigation have been carefully screening potential clients in search of those who were relatively healthy before they took the drug and suffered injuries.

Patients on Vioxx for arthritis or other conditions should be getting letters from their doctors, although they can call them now.

The data from clinical studies suggest, so far, that the most serious health problems hit patients who had used Vioxx for 18 months or longer.

Despite a March 9, 2000 e-mail from Merck research director Edward Scolnick to colleagues conceding an elevated risk of heart attack and stroke was "clearly there," according to the newspaper, Merck continued to try to discredit academic researchers critical of the drug.

"It's up in air now," said Andy D. Birchfield Jr., a lawyer in Montgomery, Ala., who had expected to begin trying a Vioxx case in federal court in Birmingham as soon as next month.

Information from the earlier study went on the Vioxx label in April 2002, according to the FDA.

Studies done five years ago when Pfizer's Celebrex and Merck & Co.'s Vioxx were approved suggest the same mechanism that inhibits inflammation and makes them easier on the stomach than traditional painkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heart problems, according to Dr. Garret FitzGerald, chairman of pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania.

The European Medicines Agency carried out a review of the drug class which includes Vioxx -- known as COX-2 inhibitors -- at the request of French authorities, but concluded in November 2003 that the products did not need to be withdrawn from the market.

Wong said it look like the drug will be delayed more than a year.

If Vioxx is found to be defective under certain state laws, the timing and the circumstances of the recall could become a factor in determining whether Merck behaved so negligently or recklessly that it should pay punitive damages.

Anti-inflammatory drugs like Vioxx, which is being pulled off the market after it was linked to cardiac problems, could pose similar riskald of the University of Pennsylvania, who led one of the studies funded by the two pharmaceutical firms.

"Our lawsuit was in the works but the filing was accelerated by the recall," said Don S. Strong, a lawyer who filed a suit against Merck on Thursday in U.S.District Court in Oklahoma City.

More than 105 million Vioxx prescriptions have been filled for about 20 million consumers since the drug was first sold in August 1999, according to the company.

The plaintiffs' lawyers plan to compare notes next week on the types of clients who may make the strongest cases, with a premium on people who were in demonstrably good health before taking Vioxx.

The Food and Drug Administration published a report on its Web site on Tuesday by a staff researcher, concluding that more than 27,000 deaths could be attributed to Vioxx based on comparisons with how patients taking other painkillers had fared.

"The evidence is no better," said Robert E. Cartwright Jr., a San Francisco lawyer whose lawsuits against Merck are among approximately 285 similar cases that have been consolidated before a single California state judge in Los Angeles.

Mayer, a lawyer at Hughes Hubbard & Reed, a firm retained by Merck, said the company "continues to believe it has strong and meritorious defenses to the lawsuits brought against it."

The results of that study came on the heels of an earlier study that showed a greater number of heart attacks in patients taking Vioxx, although there were fewer stomach ulcers and bleeding.

More than 20 million Americans have used Vioxx since it went on the market in 1999.

The lawsuits blame Vioxx -- currently used by about 1.3 million Americans and 700,000 arthritis sufferers in other countries -- for heart attacks, strokes and other health problems.

Until the new study, Vioxx seemed the best alternative for some patients despite a caution on its label from an earlier study.

That's despite the fact that the company did not announce until the final day of the third quarter that it was withdrawing Vioxx, a popular treatment for arthritis and acute pain, because a study found it increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

"It's been a quiet little mass tort for a long time," said Carlene Rhodes Lewis, a Houston lawyer whose firm was among the pioneers when it began filing Vioxx complaints in 2001.

They were discovered later.

Hundreds of lawsuits had been filed against Merck, which is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., long before last week's recall decision.

A high dose increased risk by 3.7-fold and standard-dose by 1.5-fold compared to a rival drug produced by Pfizer, Celebrex, or celecoxib, the FDA said.

"This represents the largest prescription-drug withdrawal in history, but had the many warning signs along the way been heeded, such a debacle could have been prevented," he said.

The lawsuit says that Strong's client suffered ministrokes and a number of heart problems from taking Vioxx.

One Vioxx case brought by a plaintiff in Alabama is scheduled for trial in December.

She called FitzGerald's contention "an interesting theory," but said, "there is no evidence" of increased risk of heart problems among the 75 million Americans who have taken Celebrex.

Vioxx, which is scientifically known as rofecoxib, has been marketed in more than 80 countries and produced sales of 2.5 billion dollars in 2003.

Assuming the Vioxx cases follow the pattern of other major product liability battles, a surge in lawsuits could well encourage court-ordered consolidation of the litigation, hastening its resolution.

Many plaintiffs' lawyers say it is too early to make a realistic assessment of Merck's financial vulnerability.

The lawyers expect the discussions to begin informally on Tuesday in Pasadena, Calif., in the hallways of a conference on Vioxx litigation that will also be open to defense lawyers.

That case would be hard to make without supportive testimony from the agency, some lawyers said.

It was not stopped earlier because trial results did not find increased risk in the first 18 months of the trial, the FDA said.

FitzGerald said he thinks the problem of increased risk also applies to Pfizer's Celebrex and Bextra.

They may review patients' conditions to see if they still need medicine, she and Miller said.

In 2003, some 3.4 million prescriptions for Vioxx were written in Canada, according to the law firm.

The Journal reported that one training document from Merck listed potentially difficult questions about the drug and stated in capital letters, "DODGE!"

But some experienced product liability lawyers say a new wave of litigation may not necessarily be more distracting for Merck than the suits that are already working their way through the courts.

The study concluded that Vioxx, known under the chemical name rofecoxib, "increases the risk of serious coronary heart disease defined as acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death," the FDA study concluded.

"There's no evidence we're aware of the other Cox-2 drugs have similar effects, but we don't really have studies that are long enough (to know)," Miller said.

Last Friday, Merck acknowledged some sealed trial documents had been made public, noting that in other similar court cases documents had been leaked to advance the plaintiffs' lawyers interests.

It is unclear, though, whether courts will rule that the Vioxx recall eliminates such presumptions.

"We can't compete with big pharmaceutical companies by ourselves, but when we get together, we can become formidable," said Daniel E. Becnel Jr., a lawyer in Reserve, La., who has led such organizational efforts in other drug cases and in tobacco litigation.

Concern about possible cardiovascular problems associated with Vioxx, however, soon arose.

Merck declined comment on the article.

That included patients for whom older NSAIDs had not controlled pain and patients who have sulfa allergies, of which Celebrex and Bextra can trigger a recurrence, Watson Clinic's Miller said.

On Thursday, at a meeting in Las Vegas for the plaintiffs' lawyers only, those who are suing Merck, or plan to, expect to discuss specific strategies.

Since then, shares of Merck have rebounded modestly.

The withdrawal of Vioxx leaves numerous unanswered questions about the extent of the risks it poses.

But if courts began to accept it -- or Congress made it the law of the land -- plaintiffs' lawyers would have the higher hurdle of arguing that Merck deceived the FDA by hiding or distorting damaging data.

"I believe this is a class effect" that includes similar types of medication, such as Celebrex or Bextra, FitzGerald said.

A related concern for the plaintiffs' lawyers is the FDA's continuing efforts under the Bush administration to persuade judges that FDA approval of a drug, along with warnings on the label, should go a long way toward shielding the maker from lawsuits.

While declining to comment directly on the legal impact of Vioxx's withdrawal, Theodore V.H.

Baycol's maker, the Bayer Group of Germany, said in late September that it had paid $1.09 billion to settle 2,861 lawsuits and that 7,577 suits were pending.

The FDA needs to give more guidance in using the remaining COX-2 inhibitors, Fitzgerald said in the Journal article.

Indeed, radio advertisements seeking plaintiffs are being broadcast and some suits were filed almost immediately after Merck's recall announcement on Thursday.

Last Friday, the FDA said it wouldn't approve Arcoxia without additional safety and efficacy information.

Merck recently asked the panel of judges that supervises the way mass torts are handled in federal courts to assign all of the lawsuits to one judge.

"It was just a matter of time before the recall occurred," said Cartwright, whose first case was filed in March 2002.

J. Michael Papantonio, a lawyer in Pensacola, Fla., who organized the Las Vegas meeting, said about 500 plaintiffs' lawyers were expected to attend.

"We are going to see whether there is a class effect," a spokesman for the London-based agency said.

"There's a lot of individual variability in medicines," he said.

Two newer arthritis drugs of the same type are waiting for marketing approval in the United States, but Miller said they will not be released without more review of their cardiovascular risks.

Some of the lawsuits include drug distributors and doctors as co-defendants.

"When there are other alternatives, why risk trying to use the drug that might have elevated risk?"

"The manufacturer attributed this difference to a never-before recognized protective effect of Naproxen," said the study.

"It frames the issue for a jury," Walkowiak said.

"For every hundred calls we get, there are only two or three top-end cases," Papantonio said.

Additionally, Standard & Poor's placed Merck on CreditWatch with negative implications, which sends a strong signal that the company's debt could be downgraded within the next three months.

Millions more used the drug overseas.

"The recall makes our burden of proof easier," Strong said, "because it validates what our experts have been telling us for several months."

He led the studies, which were designed by him but funded by the drug companies.

Whether the decision to recall the product ends up undermining Merck's legal defenses or improving its image to juries is less predictable, according to legal experts.

said Lopez-Mendez, medical director of rehabilitation services at Winter Haven Hospital.

"You have one person do extremely well with a drug and on the other it wouldn't work."

Merck shares had been trading in the $45 range until the withdrawal announcement, plunged to the mid $30s that day and have hovered just above $30 since then.

For the first nine months of the year, net income declined to $4.71 billion (euro3.74 billion), or $2.11 (euro1.67) per share, from $5.44 billion, or $2.41 per share.

"There's not a simple generic answer," said Dr. Randel Miller, Watson Clinic rheumatologist.

Simply switching to stronger doses of over-the-counter pain medicine is not necessarily the right option, doctors said.

He urged the FDA to change information on packages to warn patients and doctors of the risks.

In their meetings next week, the lawyers are likely to weigh the potential impact of this week's national elections, which strengthened the Republican-led effort to curb product liability lawsuits.

However, the FDA study disputed that, saying naproxen showed "no protective effect" against heart attacks.

Until such matters are resolved, how soon any of the cases may come to trial is uncertain, including one that had been expected to begin as early as next month in federal court in Birmingham, Ala.

Merck, the nation's second-largest drugmaker, has long been among the nation's strongest companies financially, with a credit rating among the highest in American business.

That was down from $1.86 billion, or 82 cents per share, in the July-September period of 2003.

Revenues for the third quarter totaled $5.54 billion (euro4.39 billion), down 4 percent from $5.76 billion in the year-ago quarter.

The group also intends to discuss ways to cooperate in gathering evidence and expert testimony, and in devising tactics to influence where the bulk of the cases may end up, as state and federal judges consolidate them.

That could have made many less likely to prescribe it.

Revenues inched up to $17.19 billion (euro13.64 billion) from $16.86 billion in the January-September period of 2003.

Their doctors can prescribe other Cox-2 inhibitors, or try drugs such as ibuprofen.

Some of them have an anti-clotting effect that make patients more likely to bleed.

And older nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, typically called NSAIDs, cause gastrointestinal bleeding in some patients.

Since then, countless other lawsuits have been brought -- no one yet has an accurate figure -- and more are expected.

Similar suits were filed last week in Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario and Saskatchewan, according to the Toronto law Firm Rochon Genova.

Many lawyers will also be jockeying for roles that will maximize their influence, and ultimately their reimbursement, as the litigation unfolds.

The state cases in New Jersey and California have already gone through such a process.

State laws will be used to determine liability, regardless of whether a case is in state or federal court.

The medical journal published their reports Wednesday on the Internet -- more than two weeks ahead of their planned publication to help inform doctors and patients.

For patients on blood thinners such as Coumadin, the combination could be highly risky without proper supervision.

On Wednesday, the European Medicines Agency in London announced it would review all drugs of this type.

Bextra, which hit the market in 2001, is Pfizer's newest pain medication.

Their less-upsetting impact on the stomach was a plus, particularly with older patients.

"This is a case that needs to be managed by the premier lawyers in the country."

And Wyeth, the marketer of fen-phen, faces continuing legal battles with plaintiffs who opted out of a settlement program that pays victims from a $3.75 billion trust fund.

But proving liability could still be difficult.

Call the doctor who prescribed it and talk about alternatives.

"To explain a five-fold difference, Naproxen would have had to be one of the most potent and effective cardio-protectants known."

So far, most state judges have rejected the FDA immunity argument.

Long-term studies are not yet available on Bextra, approved in 2001.

Becnel filed a similar petition.

Pfizer's medical director, Dr. Gail Cawkwell, insisted that its drugs are safe.

Wyeth has set aside $16.6 billion to cover its liabilities.

The panel is expected to hear arguments on the petitions and where the cases should be consolidated at its January meeting.

Several were on course to begin in the next few months.

Also on Monday, Prudential Equity Group analyst Tim Anderson downgraded the stock's rating to neutral from overweight.

On Tuesday the company described the FDA estimates as speculation: "In general, there is no reliable way to measure the actual use in the population and therefore no reliable way to estimate the actual number of events."

If it wins those trials, it could knock down the settlement value of the vast majority of claims against it and cut billions of dollars from its potential exposure.

The stock price was as high as $49 per share in February and was slightly above $90 at the end of 2000, before the recession.

They rose 92 cents Monday, to $34.23.

This week, the incentives to sue have multiplied.
