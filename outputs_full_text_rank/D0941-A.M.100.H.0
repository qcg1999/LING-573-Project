The European-built space probe Huygens separated from its NASA mother probe on Friday to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan for an on-site study of the atmosphere of Titan.

The European-built space probe Huygens separated from its NASA mothership late Friday to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan, during which it will sample the atmosphere of Titan.

With a gentle shove on Christmas Eve, the Cassini spacecraft will launch the European Space Agency's Huygens probe on a course that should send it plunging into the atmosphere of Saturn's big moon Titan.

The European-made space probe Huygens has successfully separated from the US spacecraft Cassini and headed toward Titan, a NASA official said on Saturday.

The European-made space probe Huygens headed Saturday for a historic up-close encounter with Titan, the only celestial body of the Solar system with an atmosphere resembling that of Earth, after successfully separating from the US spacecraft Cassini.

``Today's release was another successful milestone in the Cassini-Huygens odyssey,'' said David Southwood of the European Space Agency, which built the Huygens probe.

The Huygens probe, designed and built by the European Space Agency, had been carried by NASA's Saturn probe Cassini, which entered the orbit of Saturn on June 30 after a nearly seven-year journey in the space.

After it detaches from Cassini, the 9-foot Huygens probe will fall toward Titan and, if all goes as planned, enter the moon's opaque atmosphere Jan. 14.

Then, as the Huygens probe falls toward the top of Titan's perceptible atmosphere, 789 miles above the surface, its two transmitters, each with its own antenna, will signal its progress to Cassini, and the orbiter will record the messages for later transmission to Earth.

The Frisbee-shaped Huygens probe successfully separated from the Cassini spacecraft Friday and began a risky 2.5-million-mile journey to the surface of Saturn's bizarre, smog-choked moon Titan.

An instrumented space-faring emissary called Huygens will separate Friday night from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn and begin a three-week descent of nearly 2 million miles to the planet's weird moon Titan to sample its atmosphere and its puzzling surface.

It will take Huygens 20 days to reach Titan, the only moon in the solar system which has an atmosphere.

"We don't think there's any chance that Huygens will miss Titan, and we've factored in everything we know of the winds that might deflect the probe on its way through Titan's atmosphere.

Next week Cassini will make a course change to avoid following Huygens into Titan's atmosphere.

If successful, the Huygens probe will be the first spacecraft to visit Titan, whose dense atmosphere and apparent soup of organic chemicals have led scientists to compare it to conditions on a young Earth, just before life began.

Titan is the only moon that has an atmosphere in the Solar system.

Titan is the only moon that has the atmosphere in the Solar system.

The European Space Agency's Huygens probe is equipped with instruments to sample the chemistry of the planet-size moon's thick atmosphere, and may reveal whether it actually has lakes or seas of liquid methane and ethane that have been theorized by scientists.

The international Cassini spacecraft launched a probe on a three-week free-fall toward Saturn's mysterious moon Titan, where it will plunge into the hazy atmosphere and descend by parachute while its science instruments and cameras make observations.

Recent pictures of Titan taken by the Cassini orbiter seem to suggest Huygens may land on a solid surface, but scientists say they will not know until they get there.

Cassini, in turn, is scheduled to perform Monday a deflection maneuver to keep it from following Huygens into Titan's atmosphere.

Whatever it does will have to happen quickly: If Huygens lands successfully, probably somewhere near Titan's equator, it will have no more than two hours to study the moon's surface before its only link to Earth -- Cassini -- disappears over the horizon.

From what scientists can tell, the chemical composition of Titan's atmosphere reflects what was on Earth several billion years ago, when life was just getting started, said Carolyn Porco, Cassini imaging leader and a researcher with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.

The European probe will remain dormant until the on-board timer wakes it up shortly before it reaches Titan's upper atmosphere, after which the probe will begin sending data back to Earth.

Cassini, with the Huygens probe riding piggy-back, was launched from Cape Canaveral aboard a Titan 4-B rocket on Oct. 15, 1997.

After a seven-year journey, a saucer-shaped probe prepared Friday night to detach itself from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn to dive toward one of the most mysterious bodies in the solar system: the giant moon Titan.

Cassini entered orbit around Saturn in June and has made several passes by Titan in preparation for the probe's release.

That data won't come for another three weeks, during which time the 9-foot-diameter Huygens probe will chase down Titan and then, if everything goes as planned, hurl itself through the thick, nitrogen-methane atmosphere before crashing into a surface that could consist of anything from a sticky chemical sludge to poison oceans.

Its time in the spotlight will be short-lived, however -- when and if it lands, Huygens will have at most only two more hours on the surface before Cassini moves out of contact and Huygens loses touch with Earth.

On Monday, Cassini will perform a course change to avoid following the probe into Titan.

Applause burst out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory shortly after 7:24 p.m. PST, when scientists received word from NASA's Deep Space Network tracking stations in Spain and Goldstone, Calif., that the Huygens probe had cast off after a seven-year piggyback ride on the Cassini spacecraft.

The 2.7-meter wide Huygens is planned to reach Titan's upper atmosphere on Jan. 14, 2005 and go through the atmosphere in two and a half hours.

Perhaps,'' said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, the Huygens project manager for the European Space Agency.

The European Space Agency built and managed the development of Huygens and directs the probe's operations.

Sometime after 8 p.m. Friday, Cassini researchers scattered around the world will watch as the landing probe Huygens separates from the spacecraft and heads toward the moon.

Friday evening, tension-loaded springs will push Huygens away from Cassini on a free-fall toward Titan.

The $3.2-billion Cassini mission is a cooperative venture between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.

At separation time, specially designed springs gently pushed Huygens away from Cassini onto a ballistic four-million-kilometer (about 2.5-million-mile) path toward Titan, officials said.

It is the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere, but scientists can only guess what kind of surface will greet Huygens -- a sea of liquid methane, ice, or a strange hydrocarbon.

The $3.3 billion (euro2.45 billion) Cassini-Huygens mission, a project of NASA, ESA and the Italian space agency, was launched on Oct. 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to study Saturn, its spectacular rings and many moons.

After Huygens has arrived at its target, mission engineers will alter Cassini's course once again so it is no longer on its collision course toward Titan and return it to its regular orbit around Saturn and its schedule of 45 more sweeping observation flights past the intriguing moon over the next four years.

And scientists hope the on-site probe by Huygens would confirm the assumption and help them to better understand how life appears on Earth.

As long as it is operating, Huygens will be transmitting data back to Cassini, which will later turn around to point its antenna at Earth and send the data to the Deep Space Network and on to ESA's Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, Germany.

It will take Huygens 20 days to reach Titan.

Some scientists have speculated that organic material in Titan's atmosphere drifts to the surface and then returns to the air, much as oceans send water vapor into the Earth's atmosphere.

And scientists hope the on- site probe by Huygens would confirm the assumption and help them better understand how life appeared on the Earth.

The trip by Huygens is also expected to answer the question that whether there is any liquid on Titan's surface.

The aim had to be good because Huygens has no maneuvering system to adjust its own course, and it was designed to remain dormant until just before hitting Titan's atmosphere Jan. 14.

Answering those questions is the job of Huygens, a 700-pound collection of scientific instruments designed to sniff and measure the atmosphere of Titan as it streaks to the surface.

Cassini's findings from Saturn itself may help scientists better understand the origin of the solar system, but it is on Titan where they hope to find more specific clues to the origin of life.

The Cassini mission is a joint project of NASA, ESA and the Italian space agency.

That includes the roughly $500 million cost of the Huygens probe, which is being borne by many of the European Space Agency's members.

In late October, Cassini passed within 745 miles of the surface of Titan.

The European probe will remain dormant until the on-board timer wakes it up shortly before it reaches Titan's upper atmosphere.

The only moon with an atmosphere, Titan is also of interest because it is thought to resemble the early Earth, before plant life formed and began pumping oxygen into the atmosphere.

At launch time, specially designed springs gently pushed Huygens away from Cassini onto a ballistic four-million-kilometer (about 2.5-million-mile) path toward Titan.

The risky mission, a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency, will mark the space era's first attempt to explore any planetary moon in the solar system since the six historic Apollo landings on Earth's own satellite more than 30 years ago.

If the engineers have aimed correctly, Huygens will first reach the giant moon's dense nitrogen-methane atmosphere and then its surface on Jan. 14 -- to radio back what its six instruments find there, hopefully for as long as two hours.

The mission controllers also started timers on Cassini to set the precise moment at which the Huygens probe will be released from the orbiter and sent on its own ballistic trajectory -- with no ability to steer itself -- toward the planned landing site.

The probe was named after Christiaan Huygens, the 17th century Dutch mathematician and physicist who discovered Titan in 1655 and examined Saturn's rings in great detail.

That surface continues to puzzle scientists despite close flybys in which Cassini's cameras have tried to peer through Titan's smog-like haze.

"We wish to congratulate our European partners as their journey begins and wish them well on their descent to Titan," Robert Mitchell, NASA's Cassini program manager, said in a statement.

Huygens is designed to make a 2 1/2-hour descent by parachute to the surface of the moon, which, according to some theories, could have lakes of methane.

The probe must be released precisely on course because it has no means of maneuvering and will remain dormant until a timer wakes it up for entry into Titan's hazy, hydrocarbon-laced atmosphere and a parachute descent to the surface on Jan. 14.

Space scientists hope to finally get some answers in three weeks when they send a space probe spinning down through the thick atmosphere of a world more distant than any visited before.

If separation is successful, Huygens will spend three more weeks sinking slowly toward Titan.

Launched in 1997 and expected to collect pictures and data until at least 2008, the spacecraft will fly 45 times by Titan, the only moon in the solar system with a significant atmosphere.

Cassini will later turn its antenna toward Earth and send the data back to NASA's Deep Space Network and on to an ESA operations center in Darmstadt, Germany.

Titan is a key target of Cassini's $3.3 billion (euro2.4 billion) mission to study the Saturn system, which includes its spectacular rings and numerous moons.

Scientists are hoping the probe survives its landing long enough to send back information about the surface of the moon.

Bigger than the planets Mercury and Pluto, Titan is the only moon in the solar system known to have a significant atmosphere.

Giant Titan, 3,200 miles in diameter, is the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere all its own -- a dense one that has intrigued earthbound astronomers for decades.

Scientists have long thought thick clouds over Saturn's moon Titan rained methane through smoggy skies.

These are tense times for NASA and the 16 European nations involved in the $3.27 billion Cassini-Huygens project, named for two 17th-century astronomers.

Mission engineers have programmed the adventure to begin precisely at 7:08 PST Friday night, when three tiny pyrotechnic explosives on Cassini's exterior must sever three tiny bolts simultaneously and release three tightly compressed springs in order to propel the 705-pound, wok-shaped Huygens probe away from its mother ship and send it on its long free fall through empty space to the mystery moon.

Despite the mission's unprecedented audacity and technical complexity, the teams of scientists and engineers are confident that Huygens will reach its target and perform its tasks of analyzing the atmosphere and the surface at its landing site.

The data gathered during this descent, which is expected to take two and a half hours, will be transmitted from the probe to the Cassini orbiter.

After reaching the surface of Titan, if it would be solid, Huygens is designed to operate for a brief period of time, possibly only 30 minutes, before its battery power runs out.

Though astronomers have spent decades examining Titan from Earth and space, even basic facts about the moon remain unknown.

Zarnecki and other scientists have equipped the 700-pound stationary probe well: Huygens can measure its tilt to figure out if it lands on solid or liquid.

The Italian Space Agency provided Cassini's high-gain antenna, much of its radio system and crucial parts for several of Cassini's science instruments.

Scientists believe there are methane lakes on Titan.

Then it will begin a dramatic plunge through Titan's murky atmosphere, tasting the chemical makeup and composition as it descends, with the help of parachutes, to touch down on the moon's surface.

"It is bizarre, with so much scrutiny for so much time, Titan is almost (more) mysterious now than when we started this project," said John Zarnecki, a lead investigator for the Huygens mission of The Open University in England.

At least as intriguing as the nature of the moon's surface is the precise composition of Titan's smoggy, 12-layered atmosphere, which many believe may closely resemble the mix of gases that early Earth possessed -- rich in the organic chemicals essential for life to emerge and evolve.

Huygens was designed for only a brief mission.

If all goes well, Cassini will signal within seconds of its programmed release sequence that the launch of Huygens has been successful.

Titan has beguiled scientists for years because it is unlike any other place in the solar system.

Although they are intrigued by images Cassini took in October of what looks to be an irregular land mass dubbed Xanadu, scientists said Friday that they had no fixed idea where the probe would land.

Instruments aboard the probe will investigate the atmosphere's chemistry and cameras will try to record images of the surface.

One of the great mysteries of the Huygens visit will be what kind of landscape greets the probe.

Though the spacecraft's cameras were able to penetrate the haze in places, the images beamed back to earth only whetted scientists' appetites for the second part of the mission, Huygens' dramatic plunge.

Huygens, which can float, is designed to hit the planet's surface at less than 20 mph, he said, and it may be able to send pictures for a half hour from the ground, a lake or whatever else it encounters.

"It all looks good, and we've a green light to proceed," said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, the Huygens probe's chief scientist and mission manager in an interview during the recent San Francisco meeting of the American Geophysical Union.

Huygens's suicide plunge is the most dramatic moment planned for the four years the spacecraft Cassini will spend circling the planet and its 31 known moons.

"(Titan) doesn't have liquid water, because it's too cold ... but chemical processes that are happening slowly there might be similar to what happened on Earth," Porco said.

The moon's frigid temperatures -- estimated to be around minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit -- make Titan an inhospitable environment for life, but may have helped preserve concentrations of organic matter similar to those on Earth before life began.

A detailed analysis of data from the release was under way, but there were no indications of any problems, said Earl Maize, the Cassini deputy program manager at JPL.

Friday holds a pivotal moment for Cassini, partly built in and partly controlled from Colorado and estimated to cost the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the European Space Agency $3.3 billion.

With the Saturn system averaging about 890 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers) from the sun, Titan has a surface temperature of minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (143 Celsius).

"The probe successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter," Rosemary Sullivant, a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory told AFP.

After touching down at 15 mph (24 kph), it may continue sending data for up to 30 minutes, when either its battery fails or Cassini vanishes over Titan's horizon.

The springs are designed to give Huygens (pronounced HOY-ginz) "a good spin" -- seven revolutions per minute -- and thrust it into the void, first at less than 1 mph, but then quickly to a speed relative to orbiting Cassini of about 13,500 mph, according to deputy mission operations manager Earl Maize at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

The move will also help establish the required geometry between the probe and the orbiter for radio communications during the European probe's descent.

Scientists believe Titan may have organic _ meaning carbon-based _ compounds similar those that existed on the early Earth.

After entering the atmosphere it will deploy a huge parachute that will allow it to make a 2 1/2-hour descent while radioing findings back to Cassini.

Titan's strong winds could blow it hundreds of miles across the surface.

Zarnecki, who designed the probe's surface scientific instruments, says he hopes to find a deep sea of liquid methane and ethane.

The elaborate and expensive Cassini-Huygens project, launched in 1997, is a dramatic departure from NASA's recent mantra of "faster, better, cheaper," and, if successful, will probably serve as a model for more ambitious exploration projects.

With Cassini moving on its regular programmed orbit around Saturn this week, engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory signaled the spacecraft Tuesday to perform its eighth and final "orbit deflection maneuver," altering its flight path slightly and putting it on a direct collision course for Titan.

A signal confirming release of the probe was received at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at 7:24 p.m. PST (0324 GMT Saturday).

Earth's biological and geological processes have erased the evidence from those early years, so scientists' best hope is to analyze similar conditions on another planetary body, such as Titan.

It's not known whether Huygens will drop into liquid or onto a hard surface, where it may operate for a few minutes.

Confirmation of a successful release should be received by NASA's Deep Space Network antennas in Spain and Goldstone, California, just before 0400 GMT Saturday (11 p.m. EST Friday), Jet Propulsion Laboratory said.

Rasbach said he's proud to be part of the Cassini team, although the mission isn't likely to have practical outcomes.

Then the US orbiter will point its antenna to Earth and relay the data through the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration to the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany.

NASA said in an online news release that its Deep Space Network tracking stations in Madrid, Spain, and Goldstone, California, received the signal at about 10:24 p.m. EST (0324 GMT).

"The probe successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter," Rosemary Sullivant, a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, told AFP in a brief telephone interview.

The European probe is scheduled to arrive at its destination on January 14.

Cassini reached Saturn in July, the first part of a two-part scientific exploration.

On Jan. 14, it will float through the atmosphere on parachutes, shooting pictures for 2 1/2 hours before it hits the surface.

Many scientists suspect the moon has its own weather, as well as chemical cycles similar to those on Earth, and can even help researchers understand how life originated here.

Three parachutes will deploy, allowing the probe, which is designed primarily to study the atmosphere, to spend 2 1/2 hours measuring temperature, wind speed, pressure, and atmospheric composition, all while snapping more than 1,100 pictures.

Too frigid at minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit to grow life itself, Titan is a kind of frozen museum piece of what an early, Earth-like planet might look like.

Cassini, which arrived in Saturn's orbit earlier this year, has already discovered several moons and has sent back some of the most detailed pictures of Saturn's elaborate rings.

During the nearly seven years Cassini took to reach the ringed planet, the attached probe was powered through an umbilical cable and awakened from sleep mode every six months for tests.

Some believed the liquid pooled on the planet's surface, perhaps forming lakes or seas reminiscent of Earth's.

But that message -- traveling at the speed of light -- will take one hour, seven minutes and 39 seconds to reach the eager scientists and engineers at JPL and the European Space Agency's control center in Darmstadt, Germany.

Cassini was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Oct. 15, 1997, and arrived at Saturn in June.

Huygens  yet to be determined nature.

Previous observations have suggested that the moon has a hazy atmosphere of organic matter and a possibly rich top layer filled with carbon-based compounds of the kind that were on Earth at the time when life is thought to have arisen.

The mission may help prove, or disprove, a long-held hypothesis that Titan may even have rain as well as lakes and rivers, albeit containing not water by unknown muddy substances.

By the time the orbiter comes around again weeks later, Huygens's batteries will be frozen solid.

Larry Esposito, a University of Colorado planetary scientist, said he's "just burning with curiosity" to see what's captured by the probe's cameras, which were built by Lockheed Martin engineers in Jefferson County.

Rich with nitrogen and containing about 6 percent methane, the atmosphere is 1 1/2 times thicker than Earth's.

Cassini was equipped with springs to gently push the 705-pound (320-kilogram) probe away at a rate of one foot per second and impart a stabilizing spin of seven revolutions per minute.

If there is wind, some astronomers say, Titan's relatively weak gravity could mean waves could reach hundreds of feet high, slowly moving across its surface.

The mission follows a tumultuous two years at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, during which occurred the Columbia shuttle tragedy, a successful robotic landing on Mars, and, more recently, a largely failed attempt to bring back solar particles from space.

"They received the signal, I think, at 7:24 (0324 GMT Saturday) this evening Pacific time," she said.

"We are very excited to see the probe off and to have accomplished this part of our job."

It flew twice past Venus, once past Earth and once past Jupiter and traveled a total of 2.2 billion miles before passing through Saturn's rings and swinging into its first orbit around the planet on July 1.

Scientists have not seen any meteorite craters on the surface but suspect they could exist, buried under a lake or a gooey mixture of organic matter.

"But there's still a lot to come.

"It could be the first time we've done oceanography somewhere else," said Zarnecki.

Its chemistry is believed to be very similar to that of early Earth before life formed.

Its chemistry is believed to be very similar to that of the early Earth before life is formed.

The camera has been tested every six months on the seven-year journey to Saturn, he said, and appears to be functioning well.

Cassini first used its array of imaging devices to take detailed pictures as it flew through the planet's spectacular rings and swung past chilled and broken moons.

"This was a big one partly because we had to do this right or no mission at all," said David Southwood, the ESA science program director.

"Now all our hopes and expectations are focused on getting the first in-situ data from a new world we've been dreaming of exploring for decades," Southwood said.

Recent images of the moon -- about half the size of Earth -- show dark regions next to a light one.

The probe could probably float on a methane lake and has sonar that may be able to measure depth if it lands on liquid, or even the distance to nearby rocks to measure the terrain if it lands on solid ground.

Just what the probe will encounter -- a landing site marked by hard-frozen ice, lakes of liquid tar, ancient craters drowned in oozing chemical slush, or volcanoes spouting organic ices -- remains unknown to astronomers waiting all over the world.

The sturdy probe will have to endure temperatures of about 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit from atmospheric friction during its entry.

The largest and most ambitious interplanetary probe ever launched, the 6-ton spacecraft lifted off Oct. 15, 1997.

The location is marked by what Cassini's cameras have seen as interlocking light and dark areas, which may be plateaus next to mountain spires or low-lying solids or even liquids.

"We don't know yet," said Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona, a planetary scientist working on the mission.

David Southwood, director for science at the European Space Agency, thanked his American colleagues for their assistance in the project and expressed confidence in continued fruitful cooperation between the two sides.

The planned cost of the entire joint mission is $3.2 billion.

All systems were said to have performed flawlessly in the separation.

"We are quite confident we had a very clean release," he said.

Lockheed Martin engineer Chuck Rasbach helped design one of the Huygens cameras, which he called "rugged, robust and compact."

The mission involved 260 scientists from 17 nations.

"I'm guessing it'll look a little like a bad day of skiing at Vail, when all the snow is dirty and hummocked, it's slushy and muddy, ... (and) maybe there's water underneath," Esposito said.

"We tested and tested the system again and again long ago because releasing those springs simultaneously is critically important, and we're confident it's ready," Maize said.

The actual event occurred earlier, but it took more than an hour for radio signals to cross the hundreds of millions of miles between Saturn and Earth.

Some kind of flow on the surface?

"This will be like a Jules Verne adventure," she said.

Perhaps.

Perhaps.

"With space, well, ... it moves humanity forward."

Or maybe we won't."

"Maybe we'll see cliffs and cracks, maybe we'll see meandering streams and valleys.

Some scientists, such as Zarnecki, have been working on the project for more than 15 years -- and are unlikely to have another chance for a direct visit to such a distant body.

``Now all of our hopes and expectations are focused on getting the first (close-up) data from a new world we've been dreaming of exploring for decades.''

"I wouldn't mind designing telephones, because it's practical, you use a telephone every day," he said.

We've got a hell of a long way to go."

"They received the signal, I think at 7:24 (0324 GMT) this evening."

Three parachutes will slow its descent so that the instruments it carries can have enough time to take detailed readings.

Imaging scientists have discerned distinct dark and light-colored areas, sometimes toying with such words as "islands" to describe features, but conceding they have yet to find a specific type of reflection that would indicate areas of liquid.

In addition to climate history, Lunine says he wants to study "simple nonbiological chemistry" there in hopes of understanding how nonliving compounds could make the transition to life.

And then, it was on its way.

Smiles broke out in the JPL control room where many members of the mission staff wore red and white Santa hats.

``Have we seen some craters?

"All systems performed as expected, and no problems were reported."

It looks as though it will land within a few tens of meters of its planned landing site."

Researchers, however, haven't been able to figure out which is higher in elevation, let alone what they're made of.

It is scheduled to arrive at its destination on January 14.
