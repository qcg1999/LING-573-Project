The news that Peter Jennings will be absent from "World News Tonight" for an indeterminate period while he is being treated for lung cancer has, at least from a business perspective, had its most profound impact on Jennings' ultimate boss, David Westin, the president of ABC News.

ABC News emphasized that Jennings would remain its evening news anchor.

"World News Tonight" anchor Peter Jennings has lung cancer, ABC announced Tuesday, but plans to remain on the job throughout his treatment.

E-mail messages released Tuesday by Jennings and ABC News president David Westin stressed that Jennings, who is 66 and who has anchored ABC's "World News Tonight" since 1983, will continue to work during treatment, provided he feels well enough.

Charles Gibson, Vargas and others will substitute for Jennings from time to time, said ABC News President David Westin.

The future of the iconic American anchorman was on the minds of many this week as the news that Peter Jennings had been diagnosed with lung cancer raised concerns that he wouldn't be able to continue as anchor at ABC News.

Jennings joined ABC News in 1964 and served as the anchor of "ABC Evening News" from 1965 to 1968.

``We are enormously grateful for the loyalty of our audience, and we expect they will continue to get their news from Peter Jennings,'' ABC News spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said.

ABC News anchor Peter Jennings has been diagnosed with lung cancer, the network announced Tuesday, and will immediately begin a round of outpatient chemotherapy that is expected to keep him from the anchor desk at times in the coming months.

Jennings joined ABC News in 1964.

ABC News President David Westin told the network's staff that he and Jennings expect the anchor to continue the newscast during his treatment ``to the extent he can do so comfortably.''

Peter Jennings, the last of the three long-dominant network anchors still on the job, said Tuesday he has been diagnosed with lung cancer.

The first message was posted just six minutes after the news broke April 5 that ABC anchor Peter Jennings had been diagnosed with lung cancer.

ABC executives stress that Jennings is still the anchor of ``World News Tonight'' and will do the broadcast whenever he feels up to it.

Jennings, 66, plans to begin chemotherapy and to continue to anchor ABC's ``World News Tonight'' when he can, but specialists said the decision to forgo surgery suggests a more advanced form of cancer for which long-term survival rates are relatively low.

Peter Jennings, the sole anchor of the ABC evening newscast for the past 22 years, announced Tuesday that he was suffering from lung cancer and had begun treatment.

Westin called the news "a tough assignment," while Jennings, 66, said it was "quite a surprise."

But TV news veterans said the network must consider who will take over if Jennings is unable to continue.

Jennings said he was surprised at how fast the news traveled and at the kindness he had received from so many people.

While still in his 20s, Jennings anchored ABC's evening news for two years in the 1960s.

ABC said Jennings, 66, would work as often as he could during his course of treatment.

The news comes at a time when Jennings remains virtually the last of the longtime network anchors.

Jennings is the last of the anchor troika that dominated U.S. broadcast network news divisions over the last two decades.

``He's a tougher man than I am,'' Jennings said.

In an e-mail message to his staff on Tuesday, David Westin, the president of ABC News, praised Jennings for his leadership of the news division over the years and expressed the division's support as he encountered this challenge.

Peter Jennings, in a statement read Friday night on ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' shared with viewers his feelings about his battle with lung cancer and expressed gratitude for the support he has received from fans and friends.

Peter Jennings revealed that he is suffering from lung cancer and plans to continue on "World News Tonight" as much as possible after beginning chemotherapy next week.

At the time, ABC said Jennings had a severe upper respiratory infection, and the network sent Diane Sawyer.

While the announcement of Jennings' illness hit the already unsettled world of network news with even more turbulence, it also jolted television viewers, stripping them -- at least for a time -- of the last of the three familiar faces that had anchored the evening news for the past two decades.

Jennings has been ABC's sole evening anchor ever since.

ABC News President David Westin said in a note to the staff that ``Peter's been given a tough assignment.

But if ABC News makes any long-term strategic or personnel moves, including grooming a successor for the anchor chair, it could appear to be preparing for a future without Jennings, who, at 66, maybe the news network's biggest star.

He and ABC News President David Westin sent e-mails to their newsroom colleagues about the diagnosis, which Jennings received Monday.

That kind of testimony from a public figure like Jennings can make a ``huge difference'' in peoples' lives, Brace said last night after hearing Jennings' remarks on the newscast.

``Network news is in a big pickle,'' he said.

Jennings was unable to anchor the ABC newscast on Tuesday night, though he had originally planned to.

``Peter is part of the DNA of ABC News,'' said spokesman Jeffrey Schneider.

``This is a body blow to ABC and to aficionados of evening news,'' he said.

Jennings added.

Until now, there has not been much public discussion about an eventual successor to Jennings, who has worked at ABC News since 1964.

After a four-month period in which Tom Brokaw retired at NBC, Dan Rather relinquished the anchor chair at CBS and Ted Koppel said he was leaving ABC, Jennings's illness underscored the generational shift underway at the broadcast networks.

Jennings' announcement provoked sadness and dismay among his colleagues at ABC, where the anchor plays a central role in leading the news division.

Jennings has been the face of ABC News for much of his 40-year career there, first as anchor from 1965 to 1968, in what he has described as an unsuccessful tenure, then as part of a three-man anchor team in 1978 before becoming solo anchor again in 1983.

Peter Jennings, the last of the three major anchors of his era who is still working on a nightly newscast, revealed Tuesday that he has lung cancer and that he will begin chemotherapy next week.

In his e-mail, Westin wrote, "It's both Peter's and my expectation that he will anchor 'World News Tonight' during the period of treatment to the extent he can do so comfortably; but, we should also expect him to be off the broadcast from time to time, depending on how he feels."

"Obviously this is a very emotional day at ABC News," said a spokesman, Jeffrey Schneider.

"It's a very dynamic time at ABC News," said Paul Slavin, a senior vice president in the division.

In his e-mail to the staff, Westin said that when Jennings is unable to work, Vargas and "Good Morning America" cohost Charles Gibson would be among the substitutes.

Westin said Charlie Gibson, Elizabeth Vargas and others would fill in for Jennings when necessary.

He broke the news to his senior staff at ``World News Tonight'' in an e-mail Tuesday morning, saying he hoped to continue to anchor throughout his treatment.

Even as he began treatment last week as an outpatient, Jennings remained a presence on "World News Tonight," albeit backstage.

Schneider said the diagnosis has not caused the network to focus more intently on the Jennings succession.

In a note to his staff, Jennings wrote, ``Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer.

``What we see in Peter Jennings is a role model,'' said Suzanne Brace, executive director of HopeWell Cancer Support in Lutherville, Md.

In his own e-mail to his colleagues, Jennings said: "There will be good days and bad, which means that some days I may be cranky and some days really cranky!

Last week, Jennings' ABC colleague Ted Koppel announced he will leave "Nightline" this December.

ABC executives refused to provide medical details of the type or state of Jennings's cancer.

Jennings, who has anchored ``World News Tonight'' since 1983, led the newscast Friday and is expected to do so again tonight.

Since Brokaw's departure in December, Jennings has brought his newscast close to the top-rated ``NBC Nightly News'' in the Nielsens.

Gibson is in Rome for coverage of the pope's funeral, an assignment that Jennings, a former Rome and London correspondent for ABC News, normally would have taken.

``But we should also expect him to be off the broadcast from time to time, depending on how he feels,'' Westin wrote in an e-mail to the entire staff, adding that Charlie Gibson and Elizabeth Vargas, among others, would substitute for Jennings.

On March 31, less than a week before Jennings disclosed his cancer, Westin announced that Ted Koppel would be leaving "Nightline" and the network in December.

In the short run, the absence of Jennings threatens to undermine one of the chief goals Westin has set for his news division this year: to overtake its main rival, "NBC Nightly News," at a moment of potential vulnerability for NBC -- just as Brian Williams has lost some of the audience he inherited in December from Tom Brokaw.

Charles Gibson, co-host of ``Good Morning America,'' and ``20/20'' co-anchor Elizabeth Vargas, who are filling in for Jennings temporarily, are considered possible permanent replacements for the longtime anchor, along with ``World News Tonight Saturday'' anchor Bob Woodruff and chief White House correspondent Terry Moran.

ABC's "World News Tonight" is currently in second place in the nightly news wars, but it has been breathing down the neck of the ratings leader, "NBC Nightly News."

Jennings had planned to anchor Tuesday night's newscast, but decided an hour before airtime that his voice was too weak.

His illness may sideline, at least temporarily, one of the last remaining lions of network news, coming on the heels of the departures of NBC anchor Tom Brokaw and CBS anchor Dan Rather from their evening newscasts.

"Jennings has served American broadcast news with a graceful internationalist intelligence," said Rich Hanley, director of graduate programs at Quinnipiac University's school of communications.

Indeed, there was ample evidence last week that viewers greatly value the intimacy and confidence they have felt with Jennings, who has anchored ``World News Tonight'' for 22 years.

Jennings had been a heavy smoker until the mid- to late-1980s, colleagues said.

By allowing his feelings to be expressed on air, Jennings gave viewers an unusually personal glimpse of what it is like to have the disease as well as offering what may be solace to cancer patients, support group leaders said.

Koppel, who plans to leave ABC in December over plans to make ``Nightline'' a live, hour-long broadcast, has filled in for Jennings but never expressed interest in being a permanent evening anchor.

Jennings, ABC's chief anchorman since 1983, was replaced by Elizabeth Vargas on Tuesday but taped a message telling viewers about his diagnosis.

Schneider insisted that ABC executives are focused on Jennings' recovery.

Dr. Scott Swanson, a thoracic surgeon at New York's Mount Sinai Medical Center who specializes in lung cancer, said of Jennings: "He seems pretty healthy now.

Jennings wrote of his coming treatment: "There will be good days and bad, which means that some days I may be cranky and some days really cranky!

"He's already bringing to this new challenge the courage and strength we've seen so often in his reporting from the field and in anchoring ABC News," Westin told ABC staffers.

Chemo strikes,'' Jennings wrote.

``Thousands of you have spoiled me rotten with your attention in the last couple of weeks,'' Jennings said in a statement that was read on air by Elizabeth Vargas.

Westin wrote that the anchor would undergo outpatient treatment in New York and that "we should also expect him to be off the broadcast from time to time."

``These are the type of interactions that have to be developed over time,'' said Jeffrey McCall, a professor of communications at Depauw University in Greencastle, Ind., who noted that competitive pressures from all-news cable channels, the Internet and other news sources limit the amount of time new anchors have to bond with their audiences.

Doctors said most lung cancer patients can continue to work throughout treatment, but need flexibility to take it easy on days they are not feeling well.

But Robert Zelnick, chairman of Boston University's Department of Journalism and a former ABC News correspondent, said it would be hard to find an adequate replacement.

Stuart Fischoff, a professor emeritus of media psychology at California State University, Los Angeles, said he is not surprised by the emotional responses to Jennings' absence from the newscast last week.

He added that Jennings would undergo outpatient treatment in New York and would continue to work on the newscast "to the extent he can do so comfortably."

After the long goodbye of NBC's Tom Brokaw (who served from 1983 until December), and the forced retirement of CBS' besieged Dan Rather (in harness from 1981 until March), the departure of the 66-year-old Jennings (sole anchor since 1978) would complete a clean sweep of the venerable troika from the erstwhile Big Three.

"Your initial reaction is you wish Peter Jennings well," said J. Max Robins, editor in chief at Broadcasting & Cable magazine.

Jennings still hopes to lead the newscast throughout his chemotherapy.

Jennings' diagnosis forces ABC executives to begin contemplating the question of succession, too -- a matter most had assumed would be at least several years off.

Jennings has not anchored the newscast since April 1.

Jennings has also been encouraged by Westin and Banner to come in and reclaim the anchor chair on any night he feels up to it, with as little as 45 minutes' notice.

He was foreign desk anchor for "World News Tonight" from 1978 to 1983, the year he was named the program's anchor and senior editor.

With his very visible position on television each night, Jennings could be an inspiration for many others going through a similar fight, said Dr. David Johnson, chief of oncology and hematology at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.

"I will continue to do the broadcast," he said.

Jennings decided late Tuesday not to anchor Tuesday night's program and was replaced by "20/20" coanchor Elizabeth Vargas.

That treatment worked for a time, but as Jennings acknowledged in his commentary on Tuesday night, he returned to regular smoking after the terrorist attacks in 2001.

ABC anticipated Brokaw's resignation by kicking off a promotional campaign for Jennings with the tag line: ``Trust is earned.''

Jennings added a similarly light note on Tuesday night's broadcast, smiling several times and noting that he was ``a little surprised at the kindness today from so many people.

"Peter is an old friend," Brokaw said Tuesday.

"Peter will once again lead the way but we will stand with him at every turn," Westin said.

Viewer reaction to his illness underscored the challenge facing the networks as they usher in a new generation of evening news anchors: replicating the strong bonds that have developed between audiences and the iconic faces of ABC, NBC and CBS.

Jennings, who had not been feeling well for months, got the diagnosis Monday afternoon and told his staff that night.

Charles Gibson, Elizabeth Vargas and others will substitute for Jennings as necessary.

A former smoker who quit some years ago, Jennings will begin outpatient chemotherapy treatment next week in New York, but he intends to continue broadcasting as his health permits.

Jennings, Rather and Brokaw once dominated the media landscape, to a degree unimaginable today, because beginning in the early 1980s they reached about half the television audience, unchallenged by cable news -- then in its infancy -- or talk radio or the Internet.

With estimated annual advertising revenue of more than $100 million, "World News Tonight" is big business for ABC.

``He's already bringing to this new challenge the courage and strength we've seen so often in his reporting from the field and in anchoring ABC News.

He's already bringing to this new challenge the courage and strength we've seen so often in his reporting from the field and in anchoring ABC News.''

Michael Thun, vice president of epidemiology for the American Cancer Society, said that ``the most effective treatment for localized lung cancer is surgical removal.

While making Jennings's condition public, the network did not provide details about the diagnosis or prognosis.

He said: "The National Cancer Institute says that we are survivors from the moment of diagnosis.

ABC, despite a stable of high-priced stars like Koppel and Barbara Walters, never groomed an obvious young successor to Jennings.

An Ohio mother said she and her children say, ``Good night, Peter'' every night after the newscast.

But the network, which has seen the recent replacement of anchors at NBC and CBS as an opportunity for Jennings to vault into the ratings leadership, is planning to use substitute anchors, including Charles Gibson and Elizabeth Vargas, in his absence.

``Peter has always been healthy as a horse and shows up for everything,'' said an ABC staffer who requested anonymity because network employees have been asked not to comment.

The dramatic news - which comes on the heels of last week's announcement that "Nightline" host Ted Koppel will leave at year's end and which follows the recent departures of CBS and NBC anchors Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw - reinforces the idea that a chapter in television journalism is coming to an end.

"Peter Jennings is one of the few anchors that people almost invariably say, 'Yes, I could see sitting down and having a drink with him and talking casually about issues.'

Once the main source of news for TV watchers, these network anchors have lost viewers over the past decade because of the proliferation of alternate news resources on cable TV and the Internet.

Although the five-year survival rate for men with operable lung cancer is 45 percent, he said, it is under 14 percent for more advanced cancer that cannot be removed.

Lung cancer.'

``In all the years I have worked here I have had the most outstanding support from this news division,'' he wrote.

Jennings called the diagnosis ``quite a surprise'' and expressed gratitude for his colleagues.

The anchor's roots reach back to the birth of modern broadcast journalism in 1938, when CBS Radio launched its ``World News Roundup'' just in time to track Hitler marauding across Europe.

Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in the United States, and roughly four out of five people diagnosed with the disease die within five years, said Dr. Cliff Connery, chief of thoracic surgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan.

I will continue to do the broadcast; on good days my voice will not always be like this.''

Alex Jones, director of Harvard's Shorenstein media center, said that when he interviewed Jennings two decades ago, ``he was embarrassed that he had not finished high school and worked all the harder to be a superb journalist.

A second-grade teacher from Wilmington, N. C., said Jennings' demeanor ``gave your viewers a sense of peace, that everything would eventually be better than it was at that moment'' and helped ``explain the unexplainable to our children.''

Jennings did not go to Rome to cover Pope John Paul II's death.

But he was unable to deliver the news last week because of a hoarse voice, and it remains unclear how frequently he will be on the air.

If Westin continues to simply patch together a lineup of substitute anchors while waiting for Jennings to recover his health, the network could squander the momentum it has already generated.

There are effective ways to treat lung cancer, but its mortality rate is so high because so many patients aren't diagnosed until their disease is in an advanced stage, Connery said.

``It signals the transition that ABC inevitably is going to have to make,'' said Charles Bierbauer, a former CNN and ABC correspondent who serves as dean of the University of South Carolina's College of Mass Communications and Information Studies.

Jordan sent Jennings a book titled ``No Such Thing as a Bad Day.''

``I think it's a mistake for anybody to think anchors are no longer as important as they once were, because when there's a crisis in America, or affecting America, people turn to someone they trust,'' said Dean, who worked at CBS and ABC.

``There is research that shows when you remove pivotal people on television from a person's daily life, they feel like they've had a death in the family,'' he said.

Whew!''

This is either because the cancer is at too advanced a stage or because it is a form called small-cell cancer -- which occurs in about a quarter of such cases -- and has already spread to other parts of the body, he said.

The health of Jennings, a former smoker, surfaced as an issue late last year, when he was unable to travel abroad for coverage of the devastating tsunami in southern and Southeast Asia.

Another television veteran, Ted Koppel, announced last week that he was leaving ABC and ``Nightline'' at the end of the year.

Such was Jennings' longevity that he was in Germany when the Berlin Wall went up and when it came down.

``Good night and good luck,'' said Edward R. Murrow.

He returned to the desk in 1978 when third-place ABC tried a multi-anchor format, which was abandoned in 1983 when Frank Reynolds died from cancer.

Norman Edelman, chief medical officer of the American Lung Association, said a decision by patients not to seek surgery for lung cancer ``suggests they believe it's already spread to a point where surgery does not offer a cure.''

A former smoker who quit 20 years ago, Jennings resumed smoking briefly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

NBC's Tom Brokaw stepped down last year and CBS' Dan Rather left last month.

On good days, my voice will not always be like this.

"On good days, my voice will not always be like this.

But TV news correspondent and anchor Morton Dean dismissed the idea that audiences no longer seek that kind of relationship.

The woman stepped right in my face and said, `Me too.

That September, first CBS and then NBC expanded their news broadcasts from 15 minutes to 30.

``I was thinking back to when Betty Ford first went public with her breast cancer, and what a difference that made,'' Brace said.

Because of his limited education, Jones said, ``he took that spot as anchor with some trepidation.''

A Canadian who proudly became a U.S. citizen in 2003, the urbane Jennings dominated the ratings from the late 1980s to the mid-'90s, when Brokaw surpassed him.

Jennings was the first to establish a television bureau in the Middle East and one of three western journalists to witness Saddam Hussein's first appearance in an Iraqi court last year.

Jennings offered a further update on his treatment Friday in a letter posted on the abcnews.com Web site.

In Rather's absence, CBS executives have discussed experimenting with the time-honored "voice-of-God," single-anchor format.

A younger generation of anchors mostly lacks that depth of experience -- Jennings as a Middle East-based correspondent for seven years, Rather as a White House correspondent and ``60 Minutes'' contributor, Brokaw as a White House reporter and ``Today'' host.

But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit.

``The illusion that television has created is that we experience events, and the people that bring us through, that are our guides, are the network anchors,'' said Gary Edgerton, a professor at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and co-editor of the Journal of Popular Film and Television.

Cronkite had to wait until 1962 before taking the reins of ``The CBS Evening News'' away from Douglas Edwards, but 1963 was his breakout year.

The son of a Canadian broadcaster, Jennings got dual U.S. citizenship after the 2001 terrorist attacks.

NBC eased the transition from Tom Brokaw to Brian Williams in December by announcing the move two years ahead of time and giving viewers ample opportunities to watch Williams as a substitute anchor.

(For the week that ended April 1, ABC's newscast averaged almost 9.5 million viewers, compared with 10 million for NBC.)

Even more significant, it would mark the end of a special kind of personality-driven news experience -- the last unique legacy (reruns not included) of the classic age of broadcast television.

CBS Chairman and Chief Executive Leslie Moonves has called the traditional ``voice of God'' anchor an antiquated concept and suggested that his network may roll out a more irreverent, multi-anchor format.

He added: "We expect him to be the anchor for many years to come."

"I think it sets the right example," Johnson said.

People think, `If he can go public with his employers about his cancer, maybe I can, too.'

Still, ``chemotherapy can absolutely prolong life,'' said Edelman, who teaches at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

But transferring viewer affection to new anchors is not a simple matter, media experts said.

The 66-year-old anchor was too ill to work Saturday during the network's special report on Pope John Paul II's death.

"This will probably be a momentous year for network news," says Michael Castengera, a lecturer at the University of Georgia's Grady College of Journalism and an independent media consultant.

"Finally," he said, "I wonder if other men and women ask their doctors right away: `OK, doc, when does the hair go?"

"You really wonder, if given this kind of narrowcasting environment, we'll ever see people of this iconic stature again in the news business."

He quit at that time, though the colleagues said it was an enormous struggle for him and periodically he was known to sneak a cigarette or two.

Jennings went on to describe notes and messages he had received from Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Hamilton Jordan, former chief of staff in the administration of President Carter.

``Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer.

"Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer.

"Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer.

Lung cancer is usually difficult to treat.

Viewer after viewer cited Jennings' handling of coverage of the Sept. 11 attacks as a welcome balm during a horrific day.

He later quit again, a colleague said.

Yet it also is hard not to get a little sentimental over the end of a tradition that well-served the news, and, on occasion, the nation.

During the TV coverage of the 1952 presidential conventions, CBS News President Sig Mickelson coined the term ``anchorman'' for his primary on-air reporter.

He added: ``There will be good days and bad, which means that some days I may be cranky and some days really cranky!''

"Lung cancer in general is aggressive," Swanson added.

"I think it says you shouldn't stop your life if you have cancer.

``He's had cancer four times.

As a coach for aspiring broadcasters, Castengera has told his students to watch Jennings' broadcasts, "because he has such a relaxed, personable style that makes him very easy to relate to," he says.

"He's e-mailing; he's suggesting stories," Banner said.

Cronkite's iconic bearing of the bad news (``From Dallas, Texas, a flash, apparently official.

``There will be good days and bad, which means that some days I may be cranky and some days really cranky!''

The winner of 14 Emmy Awards, he has reported from all 50 states and hosted specials such as ``Peter Jennings Reporting,'' ``The Search for Jesus,'' ``The Kennedy Assassination -- Beyond Conspiracy'' and, more recently, one on UFOs.

And the evening news franchise itself, less lucrative than the popular morning shows, is often derided as an anachronism with an aging core of loyal viewers.

At one point, Jennings and his executive producer then, Paul Friedman, visited a hypnotist in Boston seeking to break their addictions to cigarettes.

I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated.''

I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated.''

I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated."

I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated."

ABC's Web site was flooded with emotional testimonials from people about his effect on their lives, many referring to him as a member of the family.

"His manner of news delivery stood in contrast to but not in opposition of the gentle Midwestern aesthetic expressed by Tom Brokaw and the don't-mess-with-Texas eccentricity of Dan Rather."

Sixty percent of lung cancer patients die within a year of diagnosis, and nearly 75 percent die within two years.

Vargas got the last-minute call Tuesday night.

Steve Murray writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

At the time, ABC insiders thought he was battling a lingering flu or a similar ailment.

``Our old and trusted friend, you have looked out for all of us for so long, and comforted us in our time of need,'' wrote Peggi and Ron Barratt.

``Peter's been given a tough assignment,'' Westin added.

The National Cancer Institute says that we are survivors from the moment of diagnosis.

CBS had no replacement ready when Rather, under pressure from his botching of the story about President Bush's military service, stepped down last month, although Bob Schieffer, 68, has won praise as interim anchor for his more conversational style.

The 66-year-old newsman, who smoked when he was younger, had been feeling ill during the last several days and was diagnosed Monday afternoon.

At CBS, Rather's announcement last November that he would step down, which followed a furor over the flawed "60 Minutes Wednesday" report on President Bush's military record, left that network scrambling for a successor.

Certainly, it's been a long time.

Certainly, it's been a long time.

Jennings has won 14 national Emmys, several Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University awards, several Overseas Press Club awards and a George Foster Peabody award.

CBS tapped a veteran newsman, Bob Schieffer, to temporarily replace Dan Rather when he left the newscast last month.

In 1981, the same year that Rather edged out the eminence gris, a more significant milestone in the annals of anchordom appeared on screen: CNN, the beginning of 24-hour news and the end of the networks' monopoly.

One morning last week, he even participated via conference call in the program's 9 a.m. editorial meeting, his voice hoarse but strong.

``Life won't be the same till you're back in the living rooms of America every night,'' wrote a woman identified as Marilyn L.

While the prognosis depends on the type of lung cancer, the overall cure rate is just 16 percent.

NBC completed a lengthy and smoothly choreographed transition in December when Brian Williams succeeded Brokaw in the anchor chair.

Peter will once again lead the way, but we will stand with him at every turn.''

A woman in my building who is a cancer survivor showed up at my front door so that we could see that bald really is beautiful.

Nine in 10 lung cancer cases are related to smoking, and a diminishing risk continues even after someone quits.

By the 1990s, from the Gulf War through O.J.-TV to the massacre at Columbine High School, a multiplicity of news options and a dizzying cast of faces were available to bear the bad tidings.

By the end of the week, more than 3,400 e-mails offering him prayers and good wishes had filled the network's online message board -- many of them expressing an intensely personal sense of grief.

He also anchored the New Year's Eve broadcast at the turn of the millennium that won a Peabody Award.

Then, over a vertiginous four days that November, the Kennedy assassination sent millions of Americans to the anchor to calm their nerves and soothe their souls.

By the time newer and faster technological rivals, including bloggers who often criticized them, came on the scene, the Big Three anchors were well-established figures from having chronicled so many national and global stories, from war to impeachment to terrorism.

It was around this time that Cronkite earned his sobriquet as ``the most trusted man in America,'' not as impressive as it sounds given the competition.

This was always a man who had a more graceful humor and air of sophistication, which came from his days as a foreign correspondent when he looked like something from a 1940s movie, handsome and dashing.''

I know that all of us will give him every bit of support that he needs and asks for.

"I know that all of us will give him every bit of support that he needs and asks for."

As an anchor, Murrow was a bit of a bust, but another candidate was waiting in the wings.

It feels good to have such a family right now.''

But, the staffer added, ``this is a man who will have no time and no patience for pity.''

Vargas and Charles Gibson, co-host of ``Good Morning America,'' have substituted for him.

They have been losing audience share for two decades but still reach 30 million people with their evening newscasts.

The announcement Tuesday seemed to stun the network.

He was in regular e-mail contact with Westin; Jonathan Banner, the program's executive producer; and others, going so far as to comment on scripts for upcoming shows.

He begins treatment in New York next week.

In a videotaped message, he disclosed the diagnosis in a raspy voice, saying, ``Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and smoked over 9/11.

``Good Morning America'' co-host Diane Sawyer, as well as Gibson, would be part of any shortlist, but both seem happy with their current situations.

I will continue to do the broadcast.

NBC's Tom Brokaw signed off in December.

``They feel rootless.''

The 66-year-old anchorman had announced on April 6 that he was diagnosed with the disease and shortly thereafter began treatment.

In a note, Specter told the anchorman, ``the only way to get through chemo is to work your way through it.''

``This does give people a way to say, `Me too.'

Veteran correspondent Bob Schieffer was picked to fill the slot on an interim basis when Rather departed last month.

Dan Rather left his desk at CBS a month ago.

``Please take the time to now look out for yourself.''

He tells me, as have many others, that when it gets really bad, it will get better.

Others likely to fill in include chief White House correspondent Terry Moran and network correspondent Bob Woodruff.

Vargas is viewed as a rising star within the network.

"As the struggle continues to win viewers, people at very high levels at the networks are going to have to make some tough decisions."

The declamatory style of the town-crier announcer (familiar as the so-called Voice of God in the Hollywood newsreels) soon gave way to a new reportorial model in which the journalist became a commentator as well, guiding the listener through strange doings and complex geopolitics.

Murrow, of course, was the prototype for this new breed of broadcast journalist.

The anchor was always careful not to run too far ahead of his Nielsen demographic -- maybe a few feet ahead of the fashion curve, but never out on the cutting edge.

Westin faces a far bigger dilemma in the long run.

I wonder if other men and women ask their doctors right away, `OK, Doc, when does the hair go?'''

When he can't, he still plans to exert a strong force in shaping the newscast.

The audience for the three major evening newscasts has shrunk considerably amid growing competition, yet they still combine to attract upward of 26 million people each weeknight.
