``I never set out to write a book to change women's lives, to change history,'' said Friedan, who always kept a sense of wonder about her place in history as the mother of the contemporary women's movement.

In June 1966, Friedan joined members of state commissions on the status of women for a national conference in Washington, D.C. Four months later, they reconvened and Friedan was elected president of the nascent National Organization for Women.

The book launched a tumultuous decade for American women, with Friedan at the epicenter.

In recent years, Friedan was associated with the Institute for Women and Work at Cornell University.

In 1966, Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women, serving as its first president.

The Feminine Mystique" jump-started the women's movement more than 40 years ago with its expos√© on the discontent among American women over the tyranny of domesticity.

``Many of us think of her as one of the mothers of the modern women's movement,'' said Kim Gandy, NOW president.

Betty Friedan, the feminist crusader and author whose searing first book, "The Feminine Mystique," ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963 and in so doing permanently transformed the social fabric of the United States and countries around the world, died Saturday, her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.

Though in later years, some feminists dismissed Friedan's work as outmoded, a great many aspects of modern life that seem routine today -- from unisex Help Wanted ads to women in politics, medicine, the clergy and the military -- are the direct result of the hard-won advances she helped women attain.

The women's movement has FACT."

In 1966, Friedan and a group of colleagues founded the National Organization for Women.

Friedan achieved prominence in l963 with the publication of her  book "The Feminine Mystique," which detailed the lives of American  women who were expected to find fulfillment through the achievements  of their husbands and children.

``Maybe it wasn't education that was the problem, keeping American women from `adjusting to their role as women,' '' she wrote, ``but that narrow definition of `the role of women.'

Her book became an instant and controversial bestseller, and Friedan became the leading spokeswoman for a revitalized women's movement.

I came to realize,'' Friedan later wrote, ``that something is very wrong with the way American women are trying to live their lives today.

Impatient that the federal government, in implementing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, did not appear to be taking equal pay for women seriously enough, she helped found in 1966 the National Organization for Women, the largest and most effective organization in the women's movement, and served as its first president.

Within a few years, Friedan said, ``I began to lose my zest (for writing the formulaic articles of women's magazines).''

Daniel Horowitz, a Smith College professor who wrote ``Betty Friedan and the Making of the Feminist Mystique,'' said that although Friedan presented herself at the time as a housewife who had an ``aha!''

In 1970, the largest feminist demonstration since the suffrage movement took over Fifth Avenue when Friedan called for a national Women's Strike for Equality.

In the 1970s and afterward, some feminists criticized Friedan for focusing almost exclusively on the concerns of middle-class married white women and ignoring those of women of color, lesbians and the poor.

Calling the feminist foremother ''hopelessly confused about whose side she's on,`` theorist Ellen Willis wrote that Friedan ''would destroy feminism in order to save it, and beat the Moral Majority by joining it.`` Journalist Susan Faludi, writing in her 1991 book ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women,`` said Friedan was ''yanking out the stitches in her own handiwork.``

What changed her mind was remembering conversations she'd had with older women while researching ''The Feminine Mystique.`` The healthiest and most vital women she interviewed had been older women -- in their 50s and 60s -- who had careers.

To many black women more concerned with survival than self-fulfillment, Friedan's call to women to find meaningful careers ``seemed to come from another planet,'' according to historian Paula Giddings.

In a 1976 book, ``It Changed My Life,'' Friedan said her mother's discontent gave her an early glimpse of the perils of the malaise she would later call the ``feminine mystique.''

They have left women holding the bag, with virtually nothing to show for themselves, after three decades of women's 'liberation' and of New Right 'family values' activism."

"The movement that Friedan's energy sparked continues to grow,  and is bigger today than she could ever have dreamed when she helped  launch it in the 1960s," Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist  Majority Foundation and a former president of the National  Organization for Women, said in a statement.

She found that books on the psychology of women generally adhered to traditional ideas of women's fulfillment in hearth and home.

"Motherhood remains the crucial unfinished business of the women's movement," says Susan Douglas, author of "The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined Women."

And I'm not that different from other women.

In the continuing Web discussion about Hirshman's article, many women angry with her conclusions still agreed with her complaints about the unequal burden between men and women for home and family.

Indeed, the common critique of the women's movement in the '60s and '70s was that it was too elitist and dogmatic, that it didn't respect women who wanted to stay home.

Friedan, from Peoria, Ill., was born Bettye Goldstein on Feb. 4, 1921, the year after American women won the right to vote.

Personally, I fail to see how Friedan's communist past -- she was 42 when she published ``The Feminine Mystique'' -- would discredit her insights about the repressive nature of a world in which women were discriminated against or barred outright from most professions and much of public life.

She led the 500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality in New York in 1970, on the 50th anniversary of women winning the right to vote.

The new society Friedan proposed, founded on the notion that men and women were created equal, represented such a drastic upending of the prevailing social norms that over the years to come, she would be forced to explain her position again and again.

Hirshman would like to help -- though not in a way many women would welcome.

Betty Friedan's other books include "It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement" (Random House, 1976); "The Second Stage" (Summit, 1981); and "The Fountain of Age" (Simon & Schuster, 1993).

Betty Friedan, whose marriage would end in divorce in 1969, is survived by their three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton, N.J.; Emily Friedan of Buffalo, N.Y.; and Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia; a brother, Harry Goldstein, of Palm Springs, Calif., and Purchase, N.Y.; a sister, Amy Adams, of New York City; and nine grandchildren.

''I thought once,`` she said, ''about what should be put on my gravestone: `She helped make women feel better about being women and therefore better able to freely and fully love men.'

Though widely respected as a modern-day heroine, Friedan was by no means universally beloved, even -- or perhaps especially -- by members of the women's movement.

"Once the focus shifts away from women's choices to the gender system that sets the frame within which those choices occur, we can see that domesticity's peculiar structuring of market work and family work hurts not only women but also men, children, politics and our emotional life," she wrote.

Among readers, however, the response to the book was so overwhelming that Friedan realized she needed more than words to address the condition of women's lives.

But in its early years, NOW's headquarters was Friedan's New York City apartment and Friedan was indisputably in charge.

Urged by her therapist not to waste her education and training, Betty Friedan began to write for women's magazines.

The women's answers gave her the seeds of her book.

Her insights into what she described as the soul-draining frustrations felt by educated, stay-at-home women in the 1950s, ``the problem that has no name,'' startled a society that expected women to be happy with marriage and children.

She was a founder of the National Organization for Women and a  leading advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment, a proposed amendment  to the US constitution banning sex-based discrimination, women's  rights activists said.

Betty Friedan invented "the feminine mystique."

The book sparked a movement for a re-evaluation of women's role  in American society and is credited with laying the foundation of  modern feminism.

In remarks following a recent speech at Wellesley College, Hillary Clinton's alma mater, feminist Betty Friedan scoffed at the notion of a presidential face-off between two women, Clinton and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

The words have the hypnotic pull of a fairy tale, and for the next 400 pages, Friedan identifies, dissects and damningly indicts one of the most pervasive folk beliefs of postwar American life: the myth of suburban women's domestic fulfillment she came to call the feminine mystique.

"The Feminine Mystique" made Friedan world famous.

Held on the 50th anniversary of the passage of the women's suffrage amendment, it drew 500,000 women.

Now a law professor at the University of Michigan, MacKinnon has a new book out this month, "Women's Lives, Men's Laws" (Belknap), which includes essays and speeches on pornography, but in recent years she and Dworkin seem to have lost not just the legal battle but the cultural war.

When Friedan sent the same questionnaire to graduates of Radcliff and other colleges, and later interviewed scores of women personally, the results were the same.

Drawing on history, psychology, sociology and economics, as well as on interviews she conducted with women across the country, Friedan charted the gradual metamorphosis of the American woman from the independent, career-minded New Woman of the 1920s and '30s into the vacant, aproned housewife of the postwar years.

She said Friedan had been in failing health for some time.

"Some people think I'm saying, 'Women of the world unite -- you have nothing to lose but your men,"' she told Life magazine in 1963.

It also made her one of the chief architects of the women's liberation movement of the late 1960s and afterward, a sweeping social upheaval that harked back to the suffrage campaigns of the turn of the century and would be called feminism's second wave.

Now, according to Janet LaRue of Concerned Women for America, "It may be that we're not hearing as much from the traditional hardline feminist organizations, but when I write and speak on the topic of pornography, one of the aspects that I point out is that it certainly subjugates and degrades women and reduces us to the sum or our body parts."

When she wrote "The Feminine Mystique," she was a suburban housewife and mother who supplemented her husband's income by writing freelance articles for women's magazines.

Rather than explain what's so dangerous about allowing women the choice of having a career, though, Human Events proceeds to quote a review that ``Friedan was from her college days, and until her mid-30s, a Stalinist Marxist.''

She founded the National Organization for Women in 1966, making it the first new feminist organization in a half century.

Betty Friedan, the visionary, combative feminist who launched a social revolution with her provocative 1963 book, ``The Feminine Mystique,'' died Saturday, which was her 85th birthday.

"Gradually, without seeing it clearly for quite a while, I came to realize that something is very wrong with the way American women are trying to lives their lives today," Friedan wrote in the opening line of the preface.

Survivors include three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton, N.J., Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia and Emily Friedan of Buffalo, N.Y.; a brother and sister; and nine grandchildren.

Despite all of her later achievements, Friedan would be forever known as the suburban housewife who started a revolution with "The Feminine Mystique."

Seeking a theoretical basis for her views of women's plight, Friedan turned to the work on identity and self realization by psychologists including Abraham Maslow and Erik Erikson.

Struggling as a freelance writer, she found that the editors of women's magazines deleted references to her subjects' interests outside the home, telling Friedan that the readers did not want to explore those topics.

She interviewed scores of suburban women.

After moving back to Manhattan with her family, she was determined to start a progressive organization that would be the equivalent, as she often said, of an NAACP for women.

In 1970, Friedan would step down as NOW president amid growing dissatisfaction with her vision of the movement.

"Since the 1970s women have accomplished something stunning," she says.

"This generation of women isn't like (that of) the '60s, which protested and tried to change things," says Laura Nevitt, president of the Denver chapter of Mothers & More.

Only years later, when she was writing "The Feminine Mystique," did Friedan come to see her mother's cold, critical demeanor as masking a deep bitterness at giving up the work she loved.

A mother of four who had bypassed college for marriage and family told Friedan: ``There's no problem you can even put a name to.

A few years later, she was a distinguished visiting professor at Cornell University, where she used a $1 million Ford Foundation grant to conduct a three-year study on women, men, work, family and public policy.

She insisted that the women's movement remain in the mainstream of American life, objecting to the ``bra-burning, anti-man, politics-of-orgasm school.''

Betty Friedan, the writer, thinker and activist who almost single-handedly revived feminism with her 1963 book ``The Feminine Mystique,'' died of congestive heart failure Saturday, her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.

This brings to mind, she wrote, "Betty Friedan's 1963 classic, 'The Feminine Mystique.'

Having discovered Marxism in college, Friedan decided that she would work for the ``revolution.''

Writing in The New York Times Book Review in April 1963, Lucy Freeman called "The Feminine Mystique" a "highly readable, provocative book," but went on to question its basic premise, writing, of Friedan:

It is, as Hirshman freely acknowledges, precisely what Friedan argued in "The Feminine Mystique," first published more than 40 years ago.

In her new book "Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety," Judith Warner also criticizes the emerging mother's movement.

``She was a giant in the 20th century for women and most significantly was a catalyst for change in the American culture,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation.

It's not clear what should give when women are still responsible for a disproportionate share of the housework, they miss their children while they're at work all day, good child care is expensive, and time off or part-time work hampers a career.

The angst, hidden behind all the obsession with trivia, and the push to be perfect ... And the tendency, every bit as pronounced among my peers as it had been for the women Friedan interviewed -- to blame themselves for their problems."

"A 'perfect storm' of unfavorable economic and social conditions harms all women who mother, but the consequences are most severe for low-income mothers, single-parent mothers and mothers of color," said Judith Stadtman Tucker, at a recent conference on motherhood in Toronto.

"We can't as women speak out both sides of our mouth.

It gave Friedan, an obscure suburban New York housewife and freelance writer, the mantle to meet with popes and heads of state and to lead an international movement that would shake up marriage and the workplace, politics and education.

``She played a very pivotal, very critical role in launching the second wave of the modern women's movement.''

She believes that her generation, unlike the one that came of age in the 1960s and '70s, has failed to create social change for women through political action.

She was a founder of the National Women's Political Caucus in the 1970s and of the abortion rights organization now known as NARAL-Pro Choice America.

Friedan wrote about "The Problem That Has No Name" (but which had much to do with being desperate and a housewife), and Warner is concerned about "The New Problem That Has No Name," which bundles together many things, including motherhood, perfectionism and guilt.

But where the jolts of recognition in "Housewives" are embedded in silliness, "Perfect Madness" is perfectly serious, a book that strives to be an updated take on Betty Friedan's groundbreaking "The Feminine Mystique."

They want sweeping social change, a pro-mother political agenda that would eliminate policies and practices that unfairly affect women as caregivers.

She also was among the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus and the group that became the National Abortion Rights Action League.

"So the next frontier is to change the family hostile atmosphere for men as well as women.

One of NOW's most visible public actions was the Women's Strike For Equality, held on Aug. 26, 1970, in New York and in cities around the country.

She traced the change to the late '80s, when the women's movement decided to frame the debate over legalized abortion as a question of a woman's choice.

Her emphatic belief that women should have equal rights -- but not at the expense of alienating men -- distinguished her from many feminist leaders who emerged later.

By the end of the 1970s, Friedan was relegated to the sidelines of the movement she had inspired.

Friedan's private life was also famously stormy.

Their ideas informed what became her central tenet: ``that the core of the problem for women today is .

But what she discovered in the women's responses was something far more complex, and more troubling -- a "nameless, aching dissatisfaction" that she would famously call "the problem that has no name."

She was an organizer and director of the First Women's Bank and Trust.

With its impassioned yet clear-eyed analysis of the issues that affected women's lives in the decades after World War II -- including enforced domesticity, limited career prospects and, as chronicled in later editions, the campaign for legalized abortion -- "The Feminine Mystique" is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century.

Not all of Friedan's ventures were as successful.

After all, feminist thinkers have been proclaiming the need to free women from the bondage of housework for a long time.

``It isn't that I have stopped being a feminist, but women as a special separate interest group are not my concern anymore,'' she said in 1993.

Betty Friedan, a founder of the  modern feminist movement in the United States, died here Saturday of  congestive heart failure, feminist leaders announced.

In short, women were still stuck with the housework and child-rearing.

Some critics also felt that Friedan had insufficiently acknowledged her debt to Simone de Beauvoir, whose 1949 book, "The Second Sex," dealt with many of the same issues.

Her best-selling book identified ``the problem that has no name,'' the unhappiness of post-World War II American women unfulfilled by traditional notions of female domesticity.

But during these heady years, Friedan's marriage was crumbling.

But the two women's brief against pornography went beyond simply attacking its lasciviousness.

Friedan did not feel at home until she arrived at Smith College in the late 1930s.

Friedan was deeply embedded in and engaged with issues raised on the left in the labor union movement,'' Horowitz said Saturday.

The public sphere, outside the home, she argued, is the only place where women can fully flourish.

The idea was that women should decide for themselves how to combine children, career, romance and vacuuming.

``All three of them have their political roots in the struggles for social justice, for African Americans, for women and for working people in the 1940s.

Her gifted, imperious mother, Miriam, had been the editor of the women's page of the local newspaper before giving up her job for marriage and children.

It is superficial to blame the 'culture' and its handmaidens, the women's magazines, as she does.

Years later, biographer Daniel Horowitz would accuse Friedan of obscuring her past to sell books.

Five years later, after significantly more work, she published ``The Feminine Mystique'' as a book and ``pulled the trigger on history,'' as futurist Alvin Toffler said.

Feminists, she charged, had fallen into a new trap ``which denied that core of women's personhood that is fulfilled through love, nurture, home.

As she saw it, the movement had burdened rather than liberated women, burning out those who were trying to juggle motherhood and career or penetrate the corporate glass ceiling.

It promised liberation, she said, but actually betrayed women by leaving traditional sex roles intact.

Some called her retrograde for insisting that women could, and should, live in collaborative partnership with men.

Torn between the conflicting arguments, the National Organization of Women was unable to take a position.

"The Feminine Mystique" began as a survey Friedan conducted in 1957 for the 15th reunion of her graduating class at Smith.

Friedan's cousin, Emily Bazelon, said: ``Her feminism was an aspect of her humanism, and she really cared about the economic well-being of families and of all people,'' Bazelon said Saturday.

In New York, tens of thousands of woman marched down Fifth Avenue, with Friedan in the lead.

Friedan began to turn her focus to other issues.

Though Friedan was not generally considered a lyrical stylist, "The Feminine Mystique," read today, is as mesmerizing as it was more than four decades ago:

She said many of the advances for women and girls that Americans  celebrate and enjoy today "would not have been possible without her  determination and pioneering spirit to challenge the inequities when  others dared not speak."

Friedan's response was ``The Second Stage,'' published in 1981.

and I didn't go around parading my left-wing background because it wouldn't have helped in organizing the women's movement,'' she told the Los Angeles Times a few years ago.

Starting in the late 1980s some feminist scholars also began to see porn as a tool that women could appropriate to liberate themselves from patriarchal norms of behavior and beauty.

The life she led, if educators, psychologists and the media were to be believed, was the fulfillment of every women's most ardent dream.

With Gloria Steinem and Bella Abzug, she founded the Women's Political Caucus in 1971.

Yet she seemed to look back on her life with immense pleasure, saying that the women's movement had succeeded in the United States and other advanced countries beyond her wildest imaginings.

Another part of her research entailed long days in the New York Public Library, looking for shifts in the types of heroines depicted in women's magazine fiction.

But she never entirely left the feminist field, showing up at the 1977 National Women's Conference in Houston to second a resolution on lesbian rights, teaching at numerous colleges, including the University of Southern California, and serving on the White House Conference on the Family.

"The only kind of work which permits an able woman to realize her abilities fully," Friedan wrote, "is the kind that was forbidden by the feminine mystique, the lifelong commitment to an art or science, to politics or profession."

The personal narrative that gave ``Feminine Mystique'' much of its power was misleading in another way: It omitted references to Friedan's earlier career as a left-wing journalist, creating the impression that the author had never been anything other than a suburban matron.

Friedan declared herself past feminism and went to work on ageism, publishing ``The Fountain of Age'' in 1993.

.For the startling pattern that began to emerge as one clue led me to another in far-flung fields of modern thought and life, defied not only the conventional image but basic psychological assumptions about women.''

Friedan died of congestive heart failure at her home in Washington, D.C., according to Emily Bazelon, a cousin who was speaking for the family.

"The U.S. is probably the best country in the world for women who are willing to live the biographies of a male.

"We emphasize the importance of motherhood," says Janice Crouse, senior fellow of the think tank Concerned Women of America in Washington, D.C., which works to bring biblical principles into public policy.

"I was curious to see when we got to the place when they decided to sidestep the definition of the good life by Friedan," she said, "to whatever floats your boats."

The First Women's Bank and Trust Co., which she helped found in 1973, is no longer in business.

But Friedan insisted she was only being politically savvy.

The book earned mixed reviews, with some critics faulting her for presenting an overly optimistic view of the stage of life Friedan herself was experiencing.

That is why edicts that order women either to get out of the house or to stay there inevitably resurface.

For decades a familiar presence on television and the lecture circuit, Friedan, with her short stature, round figure, protuberant nose and deeply hooded eyes, looked for much of her adult life like a "combination of Hermione Gingold and Bette Davis," as Judy Klemesrud wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1970.

One of the most recognized names and faces of the late 20th century, Friedan pushed for equal pay, sex-neutral help-wanted ads, maternity leave, child-care centers for working parents, legal abortion and many other topics considered radical in the 1960s and 1970s.

It was intended to refute a prevailing postwar myth: that higher education kept women from adapting to their roles as wives and mothers.

She was shunned by neighborhood women, her children were kicked out of car pools, and her marriage began to crack under the weight of her growing celebrity.

And in the universities, women's studies scholars are more likely to do close readings of the aesthetics and politics of pornography than to march in favor of banning it.

Moreover, she observed, women in lower-level jobs were still earning only 59 cents to every dollar earned by men -- this after almost two decades of renewed feminist activism.

She recounts excerpts from the interviews she conducted with several hundred women.

While their bills didn't ban porn outright, they allowed women to sue pornographers for damages.

She found that the women who did not conform exactly to traditional notions of womanhood were happier than those who did.

In 1947, she married Carl Friedan, a theater director who later became an advertising executive.

Carl Friedan has repeatedly denied the accusations.

Bettye Goldstein was born Feb. 4, 1921, in Peoria, Ill., the Jewish daughter of an immigrant jeweler and a mother who quit her job as an editor of the local newspaper's women's pages to become a homemaker.

Two months into George W. Bush's second term as president, a cadre of Hillary Clinton supporters is trying to lock up the Democratic presidential nomination for New York's junior senator.

In her last years, Friedan split her time between homes in Sag Harbor, N.Y., and Washington, D.C. She spent more time with her children -- Daniel, a theoretical physicist at Rutgers University who won a MacArthur Foundation genius grant; Jonathan, an engineer in Philadelphia; and Emily, a pediatrician in Buffalo, N.Y. -- and their families.

While rigid doctrines may have made sense in the early days, they don't now, when major goals have been won and a more diverse group of women are in the picture.

Especially magazines that seem obsessed with chronicling what some call "the work-life balance" -- articles that Warner says can make mothers feel inadequate.

To reach the tipping point will require an "open discourse about the new future of motherhood," said Tucker, who is editor and founder of The Mothers Movement Online.

``She found that love between unequals can never succeed,'' Gloria Steinem once said, ``and she has undertaken the immense job of bringing up the status of women so love can succeed.''

That year, ``The Feminine Mystique'' became the top-selling nonfiction book in the country.

(Given that ``Unsafe at Any Speed'' launched the career of Ralph Nader, who went on to put George W. Bush in the White House, I wonder if conservatives might one day deem it one of the most helpful books of the last two centuries.)

She claimed years later to have been a battered wife, a contention that outraged Carl Friedan, who vociferously denied the charges.

In an interview with Time magazine in 2000, shortly after the memoir's publication, he called Friedan's account a "complete fabrication."

Friedan's was a voice that was loud, insistent and sometimes divisive.

Friedan wrote six books and had teaching posts at many institutions, including Yale, Harvard, the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Southern California.

Even at the time, MacKinnon and Dworkin's campaign sharply split the feminist movement.

The march ended with a rally in Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, with passionate speeches by Friedan, Steinem, Abzug and Kate Millett.

In 1947 she married a theatrical producer named Carl Friedman, who later dropped the ``m'' in his last name to create the more distinctive ``Friedan.''

Friedan was staggered by the dissatisfactions aired by wives and mothers, by their vague laments about feeling empty, desperate and incomplete.

During the debates over the local ordinances, and in testimony before Edwin Meese's Commission on Pornography in 1985, MacKinnon and others arranged for often horrifying testimony by women on the physical and mental abuse they had suffered either in the making of pornography or at the hands of men they claimed had been inspired by it.

A brilliant student who had graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1942, Friedan had trained as a psychologist but had never pursued a career in the field.

Friedan's affinity with mainstream values was the foundation of her authority.

A Nebraska housewife with a Ph.D. in anthropology whom Friedan interviewed told her:

Friedan did not conform to conventional notions of feminine beauty or decorum.She was loud, fast-talking, impatient and abrasive.

Although she said she had little, if any, awareness of it at the time, she was fearful of being ``brighter than the boys'' and violating the mystique she would dissect later.

Judging from her own capable life, Friedan expected her classmates to describe theirs as similarly well adjusted.

"This is not mommy bashing," Warner says of the book.

What is perhaps most surprising, though, is not that feminists like Hirshman believe homemaking is second-class drudgery, but that so many people still get worked up over the issue.

This seemingly innocuous term, coined by a lawyer and scholar, Linda R. Hirshman, in the December issue of The American Prospect, refers to the popular feminist philosophy that in her words declares "a woman could work, stay home, have 10 children or one, marry or stay single."

"Don't Iron while the Strike Is Hot"), women of all ages, along with a number of sympathetic men, marched joyfully down the street to cheering crowds.

They read like 10th-grade book reports from some right-wing, bizarro world high school.

The results of her study were stark: Friedan found that the avid career woman who dominated the magazines in the 1930s had given way by the 1950s to a less adventuresome model: the contented homemaker.

Friedan finally produced a 1,000-page manuscript.

Melding sociology and humanistic psychology, the book became the cornerstone of one of the last century's most profound movements, unleashing the first full flowering of American feminism since the 1800s.

Four years later when she became pregnant with her second child, Jonathan, and requested maternity leave, she was fired from her job at the union paper, an event she later would call a ``formative experience'' in her evolution as a feminist.

When they failed, he says, "It became pretty clear that legal regulations directed to stop pornography were not going to be accepted by the courts, and that probably sapped some of the energy from the anti-pornography movement."

When Judith Warner was researching her book "Perfect Madness," a sharply observed study of motherhood in today's culture, the TV series "Desperate Housewives" was not yet part of the zeitgeist.

She shared a Feb. 4 birthday with Rosa Parks, and both Friedan and Coretta Scott King were at the convention of the Progressive Party in Philadelphia in 1948, he said.

Friedan did not experience the full force of fame until Dell issued the paperback in 1964.

One supporter is her husband, former president Bill Clinton, who declares that his wife would make an excellent president.

She later said she felt like an outsider from childhood.

``I believe we have to break through our own feminist mystique,'' Friedan wrote, arguing that, ``The equality we fought for isn't livable, isn't workable, isn't comfortable in the terms that structured our battle.''

As a mother of grown children, she says, "There were days that I wondered if I would survive.

As Williams puts it, "In a way I think MacKinnon and Dworkin were able to invoke the kind of horror that they did at pornography at a time when not as many people had seen it.

"You become so absorbed in 'attachment parenting,' you put so much effort into it that you're lucky to get a shower," says Anne-Marie Nichols, 40, of Firestone, who writes the newsletter for the national organization MOTHERS (Mothers Ought to Have Equal Rights.)

Friedan was cursed, told to seek psychiatric help and accused of posing ``more of a threat to the United States than the Russians.''

In February, Newsweek ran a cover story on the myth of the perfect mother, based on Warner's book.

He strenuously objected, and Friedan amended the declaration to say that both of them fought physically during their marriage, which ended in divorce in 1969.

For a typical woman of the 1950s, even a college-educated one, life centered almost exclusively on chores and children.

Today, Mackinnon bristles at the old charge that anti-porn feminists were, in effect, in bed with the political right.

To paraphrase a famous line, 'The fault, dear Mrs. Friedan, is not in our culture, but in ourselves."'

Betty received her bachelor's degree in 1942 -- by that time she had dropped the final "e," which she considered an affectation of her mother's -- and accepted a fellowship to the University of California, Berkeley, for graduate work in psychology.

She lived in New York City and Washington and had a summer home in Sag Harbor, N.Y. Bazelon said services will be held Monday at Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York.

In high school, she was valedictorian but her braininess, she said, made her feel ``like a freak.''

"I sensed it first as a question mark in my own life, as a wife and mother of three small children, half-guiltily, and therefore half-heartedly, almost in spite of myself, using my abilities and education in work that took me away from home."

It was an experience, she would later say, that made her identify with people on the margins of society.

By 1943, she was immersed in popular-front journalism, first at The Federated Press in New York and later at UE News, the official newspaper of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, then one of the nation's most radical unions.

"I don't know about the rest of the country," she said, "but in New York and Washington, D.C., tons and tons of kids are in OT to work on their fine motor skills.

Still, today, as social conservatives lead the campaign to rid the airwaves of the taint of sex, it's easy to forget that the most powerful anti-pornography legislation ever passed in this country was written not by cultural conservatives but radical feminists led by legal scholar Catharine A. MacKinnon and author Andrea Dworkin.

So it was a deeply divided feminist movement that faced the failure of MacKinnon and Dworkin's laws, not only in places like Los Angeles and Cambridge, but when they were eventually struck down by federal courts in both Indiana and Washington.

After the romance broke up, she gave up graduate work and moved to New York's Greenwich Village to work for a labor newspaper.

Betty (who later dropped the ``e'' from the end of her first name) was precocious and skipped a year of school.

By this time the mother of the movement was being assaulted by its more radical elements.

She also turned down the physicist, returning home to Peoria before moving to Greenwich Village in New York.

But perhaps it's porn's very ubiquity that has most weakened the anti-pornography case, feminist and conservative.

So what happened to those voices?

Warner has received a lot of response from mothers about "Madness."

But it's probably one of the worst countries in the world for mothers.

Results from one recent poll showed that six in 10 voters believe that the United States is ready for a female president, and 53 percent thought Hillary Clinton should try for the job.

Friedan's publisher, W. W. Norton, printed only a few thousand hardcover copies in 1963.

She split with NOW in the 1970s after she came to believe that the organization focused too many resources on lesbian issues and that too many feminists hated men.

She argues for a nonpartisan agenda of social changes that would include affordable and high-quality day care, health care for part-time workers and their families, and incentives for businesses with pro-family policies, saying most of that could be accomplished with changes in the tax laws.

During the next several decades, the highly recognizable Friedan was often seen in demonstrations, protest marches and news conferences.

Her 2000 memoir, ``Life So Far,'' said that her husband, Carl, beat her during their marriage.

But in the past few years, a handful of organizations have begun to forge what's called "The 21st Century Mothers Movement."

There, Friedan worked as an editor at The Federated Press, a small news service that provided stories to labor newspapers nationwide.

"There's a widespread feeling in the culture now that things have gone too far, that there's this insanity, and I think Lynette and my book both tap that feeling," Warner says.

(In 2000, she won a war crimes conviction against the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic for the rape of Muslim and Croat women during the Bosnian War.)

"That caught-by-the-throat feeling so many mothers have today of always doing something wrong," she calls it.

One blogger accused her of being a sniper in the "Mommy Wars" -- mothers criticizing other mothers for staying home, for working in an office, for using or not using day care, for being too involved or not involved enough.

In "Inside Deep Throat," it is prominent feminists like Gloria Steinem and Susan Brownmiller, as much as decency crusaders like Charles Keating, who get credit for shutting down the nationwide porn party that "Deep Throat" kicked off in 1972.

This gender-based economic system arose about 1780, and still drives the U.S. workplace, which is comprised of two types of workers: the ideal, who works full time and has no time to raise children, and the family caregiver, who is marginalized, cut off from professional and social advancement.

Warner, the mother of daughters ages 4 and 7, was a Newsweek correspondent based in Paris, where she saw much more support for young mothers.

Instead, "what pornography is trying to do is create, using real bodies, a fantasy of a kind of idealized and perfectly abundant pleasure," says Linda Williams, a film studies professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a leading porn theorist.

"It was like a shock wave, because it was one of the most honest moments on TV about motherhood.

"I actually know who I'm in bed with," she said in a recent interview.

For once, some political insiders are trying to put the fix in for a woman for president.

In her new book, startlingly, she suggested that the enemy was the victim herself.

She won a second fellowship, even more prestigious than the first, that would allow her to continue for doctorate.

"Until a problem is solved, it's always a good time to solve it," she says.

They advocate for affordable day care, tax breaks for corporations that allow mothers to work part time, and laws that provide health-care benefits.

"We've been living through this massive transformation where those predictable pathways have really eroded," said Kathleen Gerson, a New York University sociologist.

Her 1981 book ``The Second Stage'' prompted some feminists to denounce her as reactionary.

After two friends track her down, she explains that she feels like a failed mother.

``It's like, `Who, me?'

``The Feminine Mystique'' was so astute in its analysis that, as futurist Alvin Toffler said, it ``pulled the trigger on history.''

When the law's constitutionality was being decided by a federal appeals court, FACT submitted an amicus brief-signed by Betty Friedan, Rita Mae Brown, Kate Millet, Adrienne Rich and others-opposing it.

In an interview, Hirshman said that in the course of researching a book, she began to wonder when feminism switched from offering a clear blueprint for liberation to choosing from Column A and Column B.

Modern mothers aren't just isolated, Warner argued.

In communities across America, "mothers were talking about that episode," says Douglas.

"I feel like saying, 'You're a grown woman.

She had wanted to write a profile of a woman who had given up a successful career as an advertising executive, married and become a serious sculptor, but editors were doubtful that their housewife-readers would be interested in such a woman.

"It will never happen," she said.

"I kept the political part of it really short, to about a chapter," she says, "but I've been shocked by the extent people are interested in the policy implications."

In her recent memoir, "Life So Far" (Simon & Schuster, 2000), she accused her husband of being physically abusive during their marriage, writing that he sometimes gave her black eyes, which she concealed with make-up at public events and on television.

But she says pornography is still a central issue for her.

In this instance, Clinton's dedication to the cause could be viewed as a political two-fer: tsunami relief and Hillary '08.

The TV character most stay-at-home moms identify with is Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), the frazzled mother who gave up her career to raise an unmanageable brood, and who feels she can never quite catch up to her life.

In 1993 she published ''The Fountain of Age,`` a book in which she again challenged the prevailing stereotypes and argued that an active, engaged life was the secret to a good old age.

"I have learned that I am basically going it alone," one woman tells her -- sounding exactly like Lynette.

But a smoke-filled room of political power brokers handpicking a female presidential nominee is no more appealing than one that selects one of the boys.

But no one should be fooled into believing that electing a woman generally and Hillary Clinton specifically will happen easily.

The concepts behind choice feminism took over the mainstream in the 1980s, replacing more militant agendas that derided or neglected family life.

As Joshua Cohen, an MIT political science professor who has studied the First Amendment ramifications of the laws, puts it, "A lot of the energy that went into the issue during the 1980s was focused on these legal strategies."

The cause was congestive heart failure, said Emily Bazelon, a family spokeswoman.

She decided to bypass that venue and put her ideas into a book instead.

"A film made of any typical morning in my house would look like an old Marx Brothers comedy.

"It's really your country -- and not your child, not your family, not yourself -- that is entirely out of control," she writes.

Figuring out the balance between home and work turned out to be a lot trickier than anyone thought.

The movement's senior theorist always had insisted that men were not the enemy.

Last month, Adelphia Communications became the first American cable company to offer its subscribers triple-X-rated pornography.

If Hillary Clinton is the Democratic presidential nominee in 2008, the GOP will run against Hillary Clinton as defined by the GOP, not as defined by the Democratic Party.

I used to think that it just was going to take time, that of course the younger generation would adopt a more equitable distribution of labor.

"Cultural politics is often a necessary prelude to political politics," says Douglas.

The squib on ``The Feminine Mystique'' begins with a fairly anodyne summary of Betty Freidan's pioneering feminist tract.

But my efforts at ideological toleration inevitably get spoiled when something comes along like Human Events magazine's list of the ``Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries.''

``The Feminine Mystique,'' meanwhile, checks in at No.

By the 1980s, feminism had ceased being her primary focus, and she spent her last decades focused on issues of aging, families, work and public policy.

And that feeling is one of the threads that run through "Madness," which has ridden a surge of media attention (a Newsweek cover story, two big pops on the "Today" show with Katie Couric) to debut at No.

Hillary Clinton has a strong case to make to Democrats and independents.

I look at myself, and focus on what I am not doing instead of trying to get other people to help me.

MacKinnon and Dworkin's antipornography statutes-which passed in Indianapolis and Bellingham, Wash., and were defeated in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Cambridge-made little use of obscenity standards and instead reframed the issue as one of sex discrimination.

For the first time, she could be as smart as she wanted, as impassioned as she wanted and as loud as she wanted, and for four happy years she was all those things.

These days, "sex-positive" feminists like Laura Kipnis or Camille Paglia tend to get the airtime.

Oh yes, and Lenin's ``What Is to Be Done.''

A Web site called the Half Changed World, for example, written by a self-described mom and policy wonk, said: "I honestly don't know what's going to break through the domestic glass ceiling.

As for MacKinnon, since the early 1990s she has focused on international issues like prostitution, human trafficking, and war crimes.

Last fall the memoir of porn superstar Jenna Jameson spent a month and a half on the New York Times bestseller list.

She did graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley but turned down a prestigious fellowship in psychology, afraid of outperforming her then boyfriend.

Choice feminism doesn't provide any formula or model for happily balancing family, work, love, chores, play, sleep and more.

In 1969 she had delivered her first public attack on lesbianism, labeling it a ``lavender menace'' that would tarnish the entire feminist agenda.

She was grinding away on a survey of her Smith College classmates upon their 15-year reunion, when she added a few questions and said she discovered that the highly educated and talented housewives in their mid-30s were dissatisfied and distraught, drugged by tranquilizers, misled by psychoanalysis and ignored by society.

Adelphia's role as porn pioneer struck some as a bit unlikely: Five years ago the company had dropped Spice, a popular softcore pornography channel, because the company's since-disgraced founder and CEO, John Rigas, found it offensive.

She has the next three years to build her case {ndash} and so should other Democrats with different ideas about party direction and agenda.

"The Feminine Mystique" had the misfortune to appear during a newspaper printers' strike.

Thanks to the growth of home-video pornography in the 1980s and the more recent shift to the Internet, far more people have access to X-rated material than ever before.

"The culture wars between social conservatives and feminists, which take place far from the concerns of most Americans," she writes, "are a huge and terrible waste of resources.

Issuing marching orders is simple.

Yes, me.

When she moved back to Washington, she was appalled by the parents who camped out in line to get their children into the right preschool, who medicated their children for the tiniest reason and who obsessively bought every Baby Einstein and Baby Mozart product that came out.

In 2004, Republicans {ndash} with help from the Democratic candidate {ndash} made sure the Democratic nominee was John Kerry, flip-flopper and Vietnam War protester, not John Kerry, political centrist and Vietnam War hero.

Possibly even more amusing are the explanations for each book's inclusion.

In Canada, which in 1992 adopted MacKinnon and Dworkin's definition of pornography, it was used largely to prosecute gay and lesbian bookstores and even to seize copies of two of Dworkin's books because they "illegally eroticized pain and bondage."

The anger and frustration over how little men help with child-rearing comes pouring out.

Hillary Clinton went public with the view that avoiding abortion is the correct goal for prochoice advocates.

Her more moderate brand of feminism, combined with her often irascible nature, led to ruptures with other movement leaders, such as Steinem and the late Bella Abzug.

I try very, very hard not to think of the conservative movement as a gaggle of thick-skulled fanatics.

Mothers denounced her for just about everything.

Conservatives saw her argument as another example of how feminists are intent on destroying the family.

``The head, looking sometimes like a snapping turtle and at others like a lion with a white mane, sits atop a surprisingly short body, out of which comes the voice of a foghorn in heat.

"The worst censors in the country," Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz says in an onscreen interview, "were the feminists."

Now another phrase -- choice feminism -- is suddenly gaining currency, while managing to annoy people on the left, right and just about everywhere in between.

No magazine would publish her article.

But there's significant disagreement over the need for changing the system to help mothers.

I wash the dishes, rush the older children off to school, dash out in the yard to cultivate the chrysanthemums, run back in to make a phone call about a committee meeting, help the youngest child build a blockhouse, spend fifteen minutes skimming the newspapers so I can be well-informed, then scamper down to the washing machines where my thrice-weekly laundry includes enough clothes to keep a primitive village going for an entire year.

But there's a voice that's been conspicuously absent in the current debate: anti-pornography feminists.

These days, many Gen-X and Gen-Y mothers are experiencing that same discontent.

Rarely has a single book been responsible for such sweeping, tumultuous and continuing social transformation.

And those damages, the anti-porn feminists argued, weren't merely abstract.

``In 1943, she wrote, 'Men, there's a revolution brewing in the American kitchen.'

She continued to deplore the lack of progress on issues that affected the quality of family life, such as flexible scheduling and better and more affordable child care.

She skipped second grade and was a high school valedictorian, then moved 1,000 miles east to attend Smith College.

With her 2006 reelection campaign approaching, she is wooing New York Republicans.

MacKinnon agrees, though she sees the shift as more insidious: "The data just show that pornography sets community standards, so the more pornography there is, the less will be seen to be wrong with it.

It took her five years.

But the book and the TV soap sing an almost perfect duet of disharmony together, each from a distinct point of view.

Anti-Semitism barred her father, a successful businessman, from joining the country club and other elite Peoria circles, and it kept Betty and her sister out of high school sororities.

My critique is primarily aimed at society, not at mothers."

It compiled its list by polling a panel of conservative academics (such as Robert George of Princeton University) and Washington, D.C., think-tank types (such as Fred Smith of the Competitive Enterprise Institute).

"Nearly every story comes with a message: You can take control," she writes.

Especially because the conservative movement was itself heavily salted with ex-communists.

The Bush administration has picked up the pace from the Clinton administration, creating a special anti-porn unit in the Department of Justice and hiring Bruce Taylor, the prosecutor who went after Larry Flynt in 1981, as its porn czar.

(But didn't Keynesian policies help win World War II and then produce 25 years of phenomenal prosperity?

Movies like "Boogie Nights" and the recent documentary "Inside Deep Throat" have portrayed the adult industry as an enclave for good-hearted, rough-edged misfits and cultural freedom fighters.

That Hirshman's views on family life now sound so radical is a testament to how roundly the mainstream has rejected them.

They target what they consider inflexible workplace practices and outdated policies, which they believe increase the odds that mothers will experience financial insecurity and diminished well-being over a lifetime.

At Berkeley, she won a prestigious science fellowship that had never been given to a psychologist, much less a female.

Human Events is a conservative weekly that Ronald Reagan was known to favor, and which the Wall Street Journal called a ``bible of the right.''

Her mother was an unhappy housewife whose disposition and health dramatically improved when her husband's health faltered and she took over management of the jewelry business.

"It all counted as 'feminist' as long as she chose it," Hirshman wrote.

To help me along in this process, I seek out well-reasoned commentary from conservative intellectuals such as Tod Lindberg of The Washington Times and Ramesh Ponnuru of the National Review.

Yet she was unaccountably tired, impatient with the children, craving something that neither marital sex nor extramarital affairs could satisfy.

Early polls put her ahead of Kerry and other Democratic presidential hopefuls.

One amusing thing about the list is its seeming inability to distinguish between seminal works of social science and totalitarian manifestos.

Younger leaders took over NOW, and after the publication of ``The Second Stage,'' authors as different as Susan Brownmiller and Susan Faludi accused her of reversing the revolution.
