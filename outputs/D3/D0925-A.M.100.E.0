Chief executive Steve Jobs told 3,800 software developers  attending an annual Apple conference here that new Macs will come  with Intel microprocessors "by this time next year".

If Apple is now embracing Intel, then there's some  rebranding for both companies, Intel and Apple, to do around that,"  she said.
