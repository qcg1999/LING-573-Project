The United States hopes mainland China will put off its plan to enact an "anti-secession law" to help temper the tension across the Taiwan Strait, an American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) official said Tuesday.
He warned Beijing that the enactment of the so-called "anti-secession law" is a provocation and an attempt to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, which Taiwan will not tolerate.
President Chen Shui-bian called for the nation Friday to seriously face Beijing's proposed anti-secession law which he said would undermine stability across the Taiwan Strait if enacted.
