The European-built space probe Huygens separated from its NASA mother probe on Friday to begin a descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan for an on-site study of the atmosphere of Titan.
It is the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere, but scientists can only guess what kind of surface will greet Huygens -- a sea of liquid methane, ice, or a strange hydrocarbon.
The $3.2-billion Cassini mission is a cooperative venture between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.
