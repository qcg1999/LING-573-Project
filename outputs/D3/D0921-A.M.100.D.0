An attorney who has represented Michael Jackson for more than a decade has left the pop star's defense team, Jackson said.
Jackson's lawyers allege that District Attorney Tom Sneddon is "blinded by his zeal to convict Michael Jackson," creating a conflict of interest that would prevent Jackson from receiving a fair trial.
Steve Cochran took a "temporary leave of absence" from the team defending Jackson from child molestation charges, but will continue to "collaborate" with lead attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr., Jackson said Friday.
