The case has called 115 witnesses since it began in April 2003.
Prosecutors believe Malik and Bagri were part of a conspiracy by British Columbia-based Sikh extremists to take revenge against the Indian government, which owns Air India planes, for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984.
"These admissions are the ultimate piece of evidence against the accused," Wright said.
But Bagri's lawyers contend the luggage containing the bomb joined the flight in Toronto.
Other witnesses allege they have received threats.
