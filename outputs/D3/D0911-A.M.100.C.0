Chess genius Bobby Fischer, now in a Japanese detention cell awaiting deportation to the United States, will be allowed to leave Japan for Iceland if that country grants him citizenship, an opposition party leader said Wednesday.
One of Fischer's supporters in Iceland said the Japanese government had confirmed it would allow him to go to Iceland if citizenship was granted.
Chess legend Bobby Fischer, who faces  prison if he returns to the United States, can only avoid  deportation from Japan if Iceland upgrades its granting of residency  to full citizenship, a Japanese lawmaker said Wednesday.
