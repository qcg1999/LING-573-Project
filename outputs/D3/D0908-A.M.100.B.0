The United States said Tuesday it was  "deeply troubled" by an apparent setback to democracy in Nepal,  where King Gyanendra has dismissed the government and imposed a  state of emergency.
The prime minister conveyed to King Gyanendra that recent  developments in Nepal were its internal matter, the spokesman said.
Muni, a former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said Beijing has become increasingly concerned by growing U.S.-Nepal ties, which the government of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba _ dismissed by Gyanendra on Tuesday _ had actively sought.
