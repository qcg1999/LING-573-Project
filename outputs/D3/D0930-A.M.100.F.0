About 15 percent of the flue gas from a traditional coal-fired power plant is carbon dioxide, Socolow said.
BP said the project would reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere by the power generation by over 90 percent.
Plants built with this technology release 15 percent less carbon dioxide and can be combined with a futuristic option called "carbon sequestration," in which the carbon dioxide byproduct is injected into oil and gas aquifers underground, eliminating emissions altogether.
Socolow said a 1,000-megawatt coal plant would produce about 50 million barrels of supercritical carbon dioxide per year.
