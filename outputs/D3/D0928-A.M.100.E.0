Former top executives L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz are awaiting retrial in federal court in New York on charges of stealing $600 million (euro483.33 million) from the company.
The shift may be the result of interviews with jurors from the first trial, who said that they liked Swartz, who testified in the first trial, better than they liked Kozlowski, who did not testify.
Defense lawyers said Kozlowski and Swartz earned every penny they got from Tyco.
