``I never set out to write a book to change women's lives, to change history,'' said Friedan, who always kept a sense of wonder about her place in history as the mother of the contemporary women's movement.
In June 1966, Friedan joined members of state commissions on the status of women for a national conference in Washington, D.C. Four months later, they reconvened and Friedan was elected president of the nascent National Organization for Women.
The book launched a tumultuous decade for American women, with Friedan at the epicenter.
