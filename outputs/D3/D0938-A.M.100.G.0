George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg were able Wednesday to name 31 members of the board of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation.
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation's board also includes former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Disney CEO Michael Eisner and several trade center victims' family members.
Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which is overseeing the memorial, described the new elements as "simple acts, knitted together to create a powerful memorial at the heart of the World Trade Center site."
