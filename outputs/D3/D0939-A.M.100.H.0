A man intent on committing suicide left his car on a railroad track in Glendale near downtown Los Angeles Wednesday, where it set off a collision that derailed two commuter trains, killing at least 10 people and injuring nearly 200, authorities said.
More than 120 people, dozens of them with serious injuries, were transported to 15 area hospitals.
They said the abortive suicide attempt did not involve terrorism.
Several train passengers said they saw Alvarez jump from his SUV just before the southbound train plowed into the vehicle, Adams said.
