The attack was one of a series by insurgents in which at least  18 people were killed on the eve of Iraq's historic election despite  massive security measures across the country.
Iraqi police and the US military said that a suicide bomber  wearing an explosives belt walked up to an Iraqi polling station in  Khanaqin, a town near the border with Iran, and set off a blast that  killed eight people, including a child and three soldiers.
