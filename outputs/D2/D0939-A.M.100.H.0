Several train passengers said they saw Alvarez jump from his SUV just before the southbound train plowed into the vehicle, Adams said.
The train then apparently crashed into a northbound Metrolink commuter train, and a stationary Union Pacific freight train was hit and knocked off the tracks, officials said.
A southbound commuter train heading to downtown Los Angeles hit the Jeep Grand Cherokee parked on the tracks, said Glendale Police Chief Randy G. Adams.
