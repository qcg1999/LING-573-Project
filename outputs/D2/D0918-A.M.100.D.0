Last month, Adelphia Communications became the first American cable company to offer its subscribers triple-X-rated pornography. Adelphia's role as porn pioneer struck some as a bit unlikely: Five years ago the company had dropped Spice, a popular softcore pornography channel, because the company's since-disgraced founder and CEO, John Rigas, found it offensive. Asked about the reversal, a company spokeswoman replied succinctly, "People want it, so we are trying to provide it. The more Xs, the more popular."
