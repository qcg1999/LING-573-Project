Energy Conversion Devices has other products, but its largest subsidiary, United Solar Ovonics, also known as Uni-Solar, is a solar-power business.
Last year, the solar industry produced 1,195 megawatts of new electricity-generation capacity, about the equivalent of one large power plant, Taub said.
The average 5 kilowatt residential solar system costs nearly $40,000 to buy and install, according to Gordian Raacke, director of Renewable Energy Long Island.
Its main products include multi- and mono-crystalline silicon solar cells with dimensions of 125mm x 125mm and 156mm x 156mm.
