More than 7,000  Hurricane Katrina survivors taking refuge in Texas shelters were  being uprooted again Tuesday as Hurricane Rita threatened the state  neighboring Louisiana, officials said.
The storm headed from Atlantic waters off Cuba toward the Gulf  of Mexico and was expected to pass about 65 kilometers (40 miles)  off Key West, the southernmost city in a chain of islands linked to  mainland Florida by a single bridge.
The Miami-based National Weather Center said the hurricane  strengthened Tuesday, packing winds of 160 kilometers per hour (100  mph).
