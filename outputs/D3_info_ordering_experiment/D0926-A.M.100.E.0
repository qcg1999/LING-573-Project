Fossett, who took off from here in the Virgin Atlantic  GlobalFlyer on Monday for a flight expected to last between 60 and  80 hours, said he had to deal with a number of "dramas" during  takeoff but the flight was going well overall.
At takeoff, the 3,350-pound (1,522-kilogram) single engine  aircraft was carrying nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilograms) of fuel  in 13 tanks for the 23,000-mile (37,260-kilometer) journey at  altitudes as high as 52,000 feet (15,850 meters).
