"We know dozens of Israelis have been killed," an Israeli police source said after a massive explosion devastated the vast Hilton hotel in Taba at the main border crossing point between Egypt and Israel.
A suspected car bomb ripped through a hotel on the Red Sea coast of Egypt's Sinai desert late Thursday, one of three explosions targeting Israelis that left at least 30 people dead and scores more wounded.
