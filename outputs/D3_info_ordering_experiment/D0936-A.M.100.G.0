"The nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court Justice  that Americans can be proud of," Bush said.
Sandra Day O'Connor, the first  woman ever appointed to the US Supreme Court, said Friday that she is retiring, giving US president George W. Bush his first  opportunity to appoint a justice.
The move handed President George W. Bush his first chance to  reshape the ideological balance of the court, which has immense  influence over the lives of Americans, interprets the constitution  and acts as a court of last resort.
