The US military said the raid was linked to the hunt for  kidnapped Jill Carroll, a freelance journalist working for the  Christian Science Monitor.
Carroll was abducted in western Baghdad on Saturday, by  kidnappers who killed her Iraqi interpreter, the paper said in a  statement, calling for her release.
Dulaimi however told AFP he had no appointment to meet a Western  journalist.
"The interpreters death confirms that the Iraqi press continues  to be the chief victim of the infernal climate for the media in this  country."
