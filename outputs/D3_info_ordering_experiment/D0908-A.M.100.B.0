The United States said Tuesday it was  "deeply troubled" by an apparent setback to democracy in Nepal,  where King Gyanendra has dismissed the government and imposed a  state of emergency.
Japan gave Nepal close to four billion yen (38.5 million  dollars) in grant aid in the 2003 fiscal year and the following year  relieved 21 billion yen (202.5 million dollars) of its debt, the  Japanese government says.
"Any intelligent ruler in Nepal would try to take advantage of its strategic position," he said.
