The United States hopes mainland China will put off its plan to enact an "anti-secession law" to help temper the tension across the Taiwan Strait, an American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) official said Tuesday.
Speaking with a group of pro-Taiwan independence activists, Wu said Taiwan will have no choice other than to ask its people to decide in a referendum whether to unite with the mainland on Beijing's terms of "one country, two systems" or whether to accept the "one China" principle if Beijing enshrines either of them in its proposed law.
